<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
I AM SAVED FROM MYSELF
</h3>

<p>
There is none like your wanderer to settle himself
coseywise by a warm hearth.  An outcast and adventurer
from boyhood, exiled from England for adherence
to the Pretender, my estates forfeited, dependent for
bread upon the earnings of my sword in a foreign service,
Fate tossed me across the broad Atlantic to this New World
of ours&mdash;and in one short year I had found Marjory and
fortune!
</p>

<p>
I became straightway as sedate as any Dutch burgher
betwixt Port George and the stockade of the Outward.
Camp-bred and forest-schooled, I yet discovered zest in the
problems of merchantry and exulted in the petty tasks of
the householder.  I was a model of husbandry.  But Fate
was not satisfied with its work.  Two years of joy I had;
then came the fever that the Portuguese snow brought
north from the Main to scourge New York.  In a week my
joy was turned to ashes.  She, who had braved the perils
of the wilderness with me, wilted and died.
</p>

<p>
But there is justice in Fate.  Give it time, and 'twill
rebuild what it has marred, provided always that we who
are its toys keep heads up and courage undaunted&mdash;easier
deeds to write of than to perform, God knows.  And truly,
the day Fate stepped forward to redress the balance found
me with head bowed and spirit breaking, treading bitterly
the narrow groove of duties I lacked the will to escape.
</p>

<p>
I sat at my desk in the counting-room, fumbling through
a file of papers.  There was a breath of Spring in the air,
and outside in the trees of Pearl Street the bluebirds and
robins bickered together, and the people who passed the
door were no less irresponsibly gay.  In all New York, it
seemed, none save I lacked cause for pleasure.  John Allen,
the young Dorset bondman whose liberty I had purchased
when I hired him for clerk, whistled between his teeth as he
labored his quill across the ledgers&mdash;when he was not
glancing askance at me.  Upstairs I heard the crooning of
Scots Elspeth, and the strident plaint of my son objecting
to her ministrations.
</p>

<p>
Why should that baby voice be potent only to evoke for
me the bitter memories of my loss?  I frowned as I sanded
the last sheet of a letter to my London correspondents.
</p>

<p>
"An early Spring after an easy Winter," remarked
Allen tentatively.  "That should mean a rare flood of furs
from the far savages, Master Ormerod."
</p>

<p>
I growled an assent.  I knew the boy meant well.  He
was ever trying to draw me out of myself.
</p>

<p>
Upstairs a door opened, and a yelp of infant glee rang
in my ears.  I leaped to my feet and ran into the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Elspeth!" I roared.
</p>

<p>
Her plump features and decent gray locks appeared at
the upper landing.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, sir!" she answered.  "I can hear ye fine."
</p>

<p>
"And I can hear naught but mouthing of silly rhymes
and puling babble," I snapped savagely.
</p>

<p>
"And gey prrroud ye micht well be of that same," she
retorted.  "It's what ma douce lamb that's gone wad be
tellin' ye, if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'Twas hopeless to argue with her, and cursing, I crossed
the lower hall to the room I devoted to my private affairs
and slammed the door after me.  But even as I sank into
the chair beside the cold hearth, I knew that I might not
find escape from that sweet ghost that haunted me, so real,
so vital&mdash;yet so remote.  Wherever I went in that house
she followed me.  It was as if she sat now in the opposite
chair, a bit of embroidery in her lap, her brown eyes
dwelling fondly on my face.
</p>

<p>
I rose and walked to the window, turning my back on
the picture which persisted in shaping itself upon the
hearth-rug.  Westward across the houseroofs that stretched
to Hudson's River the sun was slowly sinking in one of
those magnificent displays of coloring that only the New
World can show.  It meant nothing to me.  I turned
impatiently, and retraced my steps.
</p>

<p>
A myriad ghosts swarmed before my eyes, ghosts of London,
of Paris, of the wilderness, of many other places, kings,
queens, great lords, priests, soldiers, merchants, heroes and
cowards, honest men and scoundrels, Indians in war paint,
courtiers in five-pound ruffles&mdash;but in front of them all
stood the one ghost I could never avoid, lips always parted
as if for a kiss, brown eyes glowing with love.
</p>

<p>
I shuddered.
</p>

<p>
The door opened behind me.
</p>

<p>
"Master Ormerod!"  'Twas Allen.  "I knocked, but you
did not hear.  There are gentry to see you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I'm in no mood to see people," I answered fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"But these&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Send them away.  I'll not be annoyed with them."
</p>

<p>
The door was thrown open again with a crash.
</p>

<p>
"How now, Ormerod," bellowed a choleric voice.  "Is
this the way to treat my dignity, let alone my
friendship?  Must you keep me cooling my heels on your
doorstep the while you consider the order of my admittance?
Look to yourself, lad, or I'll have you shackled in
the dungeons of Fort George.  Ay, and there's another hath
reason for distemper with you.  Whilst I have walked so
far from the Bowling Green, he is new-arrived from the
Iroquois country, and mainly that he may deliver you a
belt, if what I hear be true."
</p>

<p>
I jumped to my feet, shocked out of my evil mood, and
chagrined by the discourtesy I had put upon the greatest
man in our province, ay, the governor himself, Master
Burnet, to whom we all owe more than we shall ever be able
to repay for the diligent statecraft with which he nursed
our community to increased wealth and prosperity.  I know
there are those who cry out against him, more especially
since he was transferred to Massachusetts to wrestle with
the dour Puritan folk and fell foul of their sanctimonious
ways and contentious habits; but I account such no more
than fools.  He had a stern eye for the king's prerogatives,
I grant you, and a jealous opinion of his own authority.
But on questions of policy he was right ten times where his
antagonists were right once.
</p>

<p>
He was a stout personage, ruddy of countenance and
with strongly carved features, blunt, dogmatic, yet quaintly
logical, a staunch friend and a fearless foe.  He stood now
in the doorway, feet planted wide, and drove home his
words with thuds of his cane.
</p>

<p>
"Your Excellency!" I gasped.  "I was at fault.  I
pray you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Tush!"
</p>

<p>
He waved his hand in a gesture of derision, but a kindly
gleam showed in his prominent eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Say no more, lad.  I know what is wrong with you.
'Tis that brings me here&mdash;and other friends, too."
</p>

<p>
He stepped aside, and I exclaimed with surprise as my
eyes discerned the two figures that slipped noiselessly out
of the hall shadows.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears!  Peter!"
</p>

<p>
The first was an Indian, whose lithe body was naked
above the tanned deerskin thigh-leggins and gaka, or
breechcloth.  On his chest was painted a wolf's head in
yellow, white and black pigments.  Tomahawk and knife
hung in sheaths against either thigh.  A single eagle's-feather
was thrust into his scalp-lock.  His bronzed face,
with its high-arched nose, broad forehead and square jaw,
was lit by a grim smile.
</p>

<p>
"Kwa, Otetiani,"* he said, giving me the Indian name
that the Keepers of the Faith had bestowed in placing
me upon the roll of the Wolf Clan of the Senecas.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Hail.  Always-ready."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And he lifted his right hand arm-high in the splendid
Iroquois gesture of salutation.  I answered as befitted one
who was not only my Clan brother and friend, but the war
chief of the Great League, and as such, Warden of the
Western Door of the Long House.
</p>

<p>
After him entered a mountain of a man, whose vast bulk
was absurdly over-emphasized by the loose shirt and trousers
of buckskin he wore and the coonskin cap that crowned
his lank yellow locks.  Others might be deceived by the
rolls of fat, the huge paunch, the stupid simplicity of the
broad, flat face, with insignificant features dabbed here and
there, the little mild blue eyes that blinked behind ramparts
of loose flesh, but I knew Peter Corlaer for the strongest,
craftiest forest-runner of the frontier.  Beneath his layers
of blubber were muscles of forged steel and capacities for
endurance that had never been plumbed.
</p>

<p>
"Zounds, man, but I'm glad to see you," I cried, trusting
my fingers to his bear's grip.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," he answered vacantly in a tiny squeaky voice that
issued incongruously from his immense frame.
</p>

<p>
I saw Allen staring at him in amazement, and I could not
restrain a laugh&mdash;I who had not smiled in six months.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be merry now, John," I said.  "They are old
friends I had not expected to see so soon."
</p>

<p>
The governor clapped his hand on the clerk's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, my lad, y'are safe to leave your master with us,"
he said in his kindly fashion.  "Y'are a good youth.  We
have room for your like in New York.  Here what ye have
been matters not.  'Tis what ye are that counts.  But leave
us now, for we have much to discuss."
</p>

<p>
I turned again to Tawannears, as Allen closed the door
behind him.
</p>

<p>
"What brings you, brother?  You are welcome&mdash;that
I need not say.  But you two are the last I should have
looked to see walk in here out of Pearl Street.  Tell me all!
How are my brethren of the Long House?  Have any challenged
the Warders of the Door?  What news from beyond
the Lakes?  Are the French&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"God-a-mercy!" protested Master Burnet.  "Accept
reason, Ormerod.  A question at a time, and in due order,
if it pleases you.  And may a guest sit in your house?"
</p>

<p>
I laughed again&mdash;as I doubt not he intended&mdash;and waved
to all three of them.
</p>

<p>
"Prithee, content yourselves," I bade.  "Y'are not such
strangers as to require an invitation."
</p>

<p>
The governor let himself down into my armchair.  Tawannears,
his white teeth exposed in a pleasant grin&mdash;for,
like all Indians, he had a keen sense of humor&mdash;sank upon
the bearskin rug, and after a moment's hesitation, Corlaer
imitated him.
</p>

<p>
"My brother will not take it amiss if Corlaer and Tawannears
slight his chairs?" inquired the Indian in his cadenced,
musical English that took on something of the
sonorous rhythm of his own tongue.  "We forest people
are not used to setting our haunches at right angles to our
feet.  I learned much from the missionaries when I went
to school with them as a boy, Gaengwarago,* but I never
became accustomed to the white man's chairs.  Hawenneyu,
the Great Spirit, meant the earth to sit on, as well as to
walk on.  It is the only chair I know."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Great Swift Arrow"&mdash;Indian name for Governor of New
York.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"But Corlaer, it seems, has been to school to your people
to better advantage than you were with us," retorted the
governor.
</p>

<p>
"The white man learns more readily than the Indian,"
affirmed the Seneca.  "That is the reason why he will some
day push the Indian from his path."
</p>

<p>
"From his path?" I repeated, interested as always in
the thoughts of this learned savage, who combined in his
own mind to an amazing degree the philosophy of the
civilized white man and the mental reactions of his
untutored people.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, brother," he answered.  "The time will come when
the white man will push the Indian out of all this country."
</p>

<p>
"But where will your people go?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Who knows?  Only Hawenneyu can tell.  Perhaps he
will care for them in some new land, out there, beyond the
sunset."
</p>

<p>
And Tawannears waved his hand toward the kindling
glory that overhung the west.
</p>

<p>
The governor leaned forward in his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, that was what I had in my mind," he declared.
"What lies there beyond the sunset?  You know something
of it, Tawannears, but you do not know all.  'Tis
knowledge of that I crave.  In a manner of speaking 'tis
that brings us together here."
</p>

<p>
He was silent for a moment, and we all watched him,
resting his chin upon the clasped hands that supported his
cane, his eyes glued upon the Western sky.
</p>

<p>
"Tell your story, Tawannears," he said abruptly.  "That
is the simplest way to expound an involved situation.  And
do you heed him, Ormerod.  There is more than a whim of
mine in this.  It may be your own future well-being is at
stake."
</p>

<p>
I fixed my eyes upon the Indian's face.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, tell your story," I urged.
</p>

<p>
He bowed his head in assent.
</p>

<p>
"I will tell, brother.  Tawannears speaks also for
Corlaer.  Is it not so, Peter?"
</p>

<p>
The big Dutchman's mouth opened to emit a shrill "<i>Ja</i>."
</p>

<p>
"First, my brother, Ormerod, whom we of the
Hodenosaunee* call Otetiani," the Indian resumed, "I will strive
to answer the questions that you asked.  I bring you
greetings from your foster-father, my uncle, the Royaneh**
Donehogaweh.  He bids me say to you that his heart longs
for his white son.  He keeps a place always prepared for
you in his lodge.  He took counsel with me before I left the
Long House, and advised me to seek you out.  All is well
with my people.  The Western Door is secure.  No enemies
have challenged it.  But Tawannears has been idle, and
so his thoughts have turned to the hunger in his heart, that
my brother will remember was there in other days."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* People of the Long House.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
** Hereditary chief, erroneously called sachem.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He rose to his feet, like all Indian orators, unable to
find comfort in delivery whilst seated.  Arms folded across
his naked chest, his eagle's-feather well-nigh touching the
ceiling, he towered above us, an incarnate spirit of the
Wilderness.
</p>

<p>
"My brother has not forgotten that once Tawannears
loved a maid of his people, daughter of your foster-father,
who was called Gahano, and was stolen from him by a
French dog, and who died that Tawannears might live.

<p>
"My brother knows that there is an old tale of my people
that the Lost Souls of the dead go to the Land of the Lost
Souls which is ruled by Ataentsic* and her grandson
Jousekeha, which is beyond Dayedadogowar, the Great
Home Of The Winds, beyond Haniskaonogeh, the Dwelling
Place of The Evil-minded, ay, beyond the setting sun.

<p>
"My brother knows it is said that once a warrior of my
people, placing his trust in Hawenneyu and the Honochenokeh,*
traveled westward after the Setting Sun, and daring
all things, came at last to the Land of the Lost Souls, where
he found a maiden whom he had loved dancing with other
Lost Souls before Ataentsic.  And Jouskeha, taking pity
on his love, gave him a hollowed pumpkin, and they placed
the Lost Soul of the maiden in the pumpkin, and the
warrior carried it back to the Long House, and his people made
a feast and they raised up the soul of the maiden from the
pumpkin shell.

<p>
"My brother remembers that two Winters since Tawannears
and Corlaer left the Long House to search for the
Land of Lost Souls, but there was trouble between the
Hodenosaunee and the Shawnee, and whilst Tawannears
and Corlaer were in the country of the Dakota, across the
great river Mississippi, they were called back by a message
from the Hoyarnagowar.*  Six young warriors of ten lost
their lives that the message might be delivered.  Tawannears
returned.  Since then he has discharged the duties
of his people.  Now he is free again."

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He took a step toward me, his face blazing with the keen
intelligence that was his outstanding characteristic.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my brother, so much I have said of Tawannears.
I speak next of you.  Word came to Deonundagaa* in the
first moon of the Winter that the flower that had twined
around your heart had withered and died.  Oh, my brother,
great was our grief; but in grief words are as nothing.  I
thought.  I knew your loss because I, too, had suffered it.
It said to myself: 'Otetiani is a man.  He cannot weep.
He has withstood the torture-stake.  But he will suffer
greatly in his mind&mdash;even as I have suffered.  What will
aid him?"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"And then, oh, my brother, I saw what should be done.
I summoned Corlaer, and I said to him: 'We will go to New
York and find our brother Ormerod and take him with us
to hunt again for the Land of Lost Souls.  A strange trail
is best for the man whose mind is burdened with sad
thoughts.  If we find the Land of Lost Souls, perhaps the
souls of the white people will be there, and he may recover
her whom he has lost.  If we find nothing, still he will have
the journey, strange trails, new countries&mdash;and the pain in
his heart will be dulled.'
</p>

<p>
"So, my brother, Corlaer and Tawannears came to New
York, and lest my thought should be a wrong one&mdash;for
Tawannears, after all, is an Indian and cannot know
always what is best for a white man&mdash;we went first to
Gaengwarago, who is wise in the ways of all people, and spoke
with him.  And now it is time for him to deliver his
judgment.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Na-ho.</i>"*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "I have finished."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"But, Tawannears," I cried, as he dropped gracefully
to the floor, "you forget that I am a Christian!  My
religion tells me nothing of a land whence the dead may be
recovered.  Think, brother, you were schooled in the natural
sciences by the missionaries.  How can you credit this&mdash;this
myth.  'Tis true I have heard you tell it before, and
I forebore to question because I would not add to your
sorrow.  But now I may not pass it by in silence.  Forgive
me, brother, if my words hurt you.  I strive to speak with
a straight tongue, as brothers should."
</p>

<p>
He lifted tranquil eyes to mine from his seat on the
bearskin.
</p>

<p>
"My brother does not hurt Tawannears," he said.  "A
straight tongue cannot hurt.  Brothers often disagree.  It
is true that the missionaries taught me as you say.  It is
true that I have read the Bible.  The missionaries are good
men.  The Bible is a good Book.  There is wisdom in it.
But the men who wrote it did not even know that the
Indians existed.  They had never heard of this country.
How, then, brother, could they know what the Great Spirit
devised for the Indian?  No, Ormerod, I think that the
Great Spirit who made the world, who put the salt water
in the ocean, which men use only for travel, and fresh water
in the rivers, where men go to drink, may well have created
a different after-world for the Indian than for the white
man."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," I insisted, overwrought by this mingling of
superstition and rare friendship coming on the heels of my
mental anguish.  "The soul that leaves the body is bodiless.
It cannot be touched or seen.  Remember, Tawannears, the
Great Spirit sent His Son to dwell awhile with the white
men, to give His life for the saving of mankind.  Yet He
said naught of this belief of yours."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears smiled scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"That is why I reject your religion, brother.  It cannot
be complete if it does not include the Indian, for the Indian
has a soul as has the white man.  But I say again: I promise
nothing.  I shall seek.  Hawenneyu, and Tharon the Sky-holder,
will decide if it is best for me to find&mdash;as for you,
also.  Life, brother, is a search.  Religion is a struggle.  I
seek for what I love.  I struggle for truth and justice.
And I believe that the Great Spirit thinks of the Indian as
often as he does of the white man."
</p>

<p>
Master Burnet tapped his cane on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"You waste time, Ormerod," he said testily.  "My
father was a bishop, and I have had enough of
religion in my life to know that Godly debates are endless.
Let be, prithee!  For myself, I care not whether Tawannears
be right or wrong.  Yet the longer I live, the less
sure I am of what is and is not.  This continent is so
incredibly gigantic that it may contain wonders our work-a-day
minds have never dreamed on.  A Land of Lost Souls!
Well, why not?  There were miracles in Judea.  Why not
in this wonderland?  But hist!  Bishop Gilbert, my father,
hath just turned in his grave.  I will ha' done.  I am no
casuist or Scots catechist, forever probing the chances of
salvation.  Nay, nay!  I have heard many creeds in my
time, but I have yet to hear one that surpasses Tawannears'."
</p>

<p>
I chuckled, despite myself.
</p>

<p>
"Already you succumb to the lure you deride," I pointed
out.
</p>

<p>
He grinned back at me.
</p>

<p>
"True, I give thanks for the warning.  Let us forget it."
</p>

<p>
His manner grew serious.
</p>

<p>
"For you, Ormerod, the consideration is not what Tawannears
believes.  You know him for a tried friend.  That
should suffice.  His offer to you is designed to lift you from
this routine, in which, dear lad&mdash;to be brutally explicit
for the once&mdash;you are unable to subdue the pricking
memories of that fair Mistress Marjory whom we all loved.  I
urge you, scorn it not.  I have watched over you of late
with misgivings.  Y'are unsound in your mind, lad, and
that's the truth on it.
</p>

<p>
"Do not mistake me.  I am no fault-finder.  Your life
has been a hard one.  You have had over-much of trial.
Your loss is doubly bitter to you therefor.  But that is the
reason why you must drink some sharp purge of experience
to cleanse your brain of the canker that gnaws now at your
sanity.  Tawannears points the way."
</p>

<p>
I looked at him, bewildered.  From him to the Seneca,
sitting cross-legged like a brazen statue, only his eyes
burning with vivid emotion in his mask of a face.  And from
Tawannears to Corlaer, no less impassive, his little eyes
almost wholly concealed behind their ramparts of flesh.
</p>

<p>
"But such a journey will require much time!" I protested.
</p>

<p>
"A year," assented Tawannears.  "Perhaps more.  Who
can say?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," endorsed Corlaer when I turned to him.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis impossible," I said.  "There is my business."
</p>

<p>
A shriek of laughter came from upstairs.  I guessed that
Elspeth, knowing I was with guests, had relaxed all
repression for the nonce.
</p>

<p>
"And the child," I added.
</p>

<p>
"Your reasons are not valid," replied the governor.
"For your business, John Allen can well conduct it, and
I will give him such supervision as he requires.  The child
is better in Elspeth's hands than any other's.  You will
mean nothing to him this next year at least.  And Mistress
Bnrnet shall keep an eye upon him."
</p>

<p>
"But there is great danger upon such a journey," I
declared shamelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, that is so," admitted Master Burnet.  "We may
not dodge it.  But you had better die, Ormerod, than linger
on in the moods you have known this six-month past.  You
have enough fortune for the rearing of your son and his
start in life.  Write your will and leave his guardianship to
me.  You may make your mind easy on that score."
</p>

<p>
"You seem uncommonly anxious for me to go," I observed
a trifle disagreeably.
</p>

<p>
"I am," he answered promptly.  "I will go so far as to
urge you in my official capacity, lad.  I am not satisfied
with affairs.  We checkmate the French at one point, or
in a certain direction, and they start an intrigue elsewhere.
'Tis an adventurous people, with a genius for military
endeavor, that puts us to shame.  And to the southward the
Spaniards are rearing a power that can be toppled over
only by their own fecklessness.  We English are hemmed in
along the seaboard behind the Allegheny Mountains.  We
are as cramped as fleas at the end of a dog's tail."
</p>

<p>
"We have not yet begun to colonize adequately this
province alone," I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"True, but we are only the vanguard of the armies of
home-makers of the future.  Remember that.  The time
will come when our people will be striving to burst their
bounds and move on onto the dim recesses of the Wilderness
Country.  What is that country?  What is there beyond
it?  Beyond the Sunset, as Tawannears said.  That is what
I need to know, what England must know."
</p>

<p>
He poked at me with his cane.
</p>

<p>
"Look you, Ormerod, there are three questions to be
answered.  First, to what extent are the French established
on the Mississippi?  I know they have built lately a post
they call Vincennes on the River Ouabache,* but I have
not been able to learn if they have progressed permanently
below that.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Wabash.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Second, how far have the Spaniards extended their
influence beyond the Mississippi?  Concerning this we know
practically nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Third, what is the power of the far Indian races beyond
the Great River, and what is their disposition toward us?
Something in answer to this question Tawannears has told
me, but I must know more."
</p>

<p>
"You have taken me by surprise," I temporized, turning
in my mind recollections of bygone venturings, the soft
clutch of moccasins on the feet, the pervading wood-smell
of the forest, the feathered whispering of arrow flights, the
thrill of the war-whoop, exultation in a close shot.
</p>

<p>
Master Burnet pressed his advantage.
</p>

<p>
"Surely, I have taken you by surprise," he persisted.
"But the fact is, dear lad, I have striven all Winter for a
diversion to lift you out of yourself and this house which
is overfull of memories for your present good.  Tawannears
fetched me what I was unable to conceive.  But I would
have you consider that it offers more than an opportunity
to escape discomfort and ill-health.  No Englishman hath
traversed the lands across the Mississippi.  French soldiers
and Jesuits have seen somewhat of it, but never an Englishman.
The man who sees it first, and brings home a true
account, will deserve well of his people.  He will have
rendered a service to generations yet unborn."
</p>

<p>
I peered for the last time at the armchair that stood
empty by the hearth.  As always, the slim wraith that sat
there raised black-coifed head in a mute gesture of
affection.  It seemed to me that she nodded in approval.  The
brown eyes welled with sudden tears.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go," I said.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears regained his feet with the agility of a catamount.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Yo-hay!</i>"* he boomed.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "I have heard," <i>i.e.,</i> approved.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Goodt</i>," pronounced Corlaer solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well," endorsed the governor.  "You'll not regret
it, Ormerod.  There's much to do.  Let's to it."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<h3>
THE WILDERNESS TRAIL
</h3>

<p>
The sun was already well above the horizon, but the
light that stole through door and smoke-hole struggled
unsuccessfully with the gloom of the Council
House.  From my seat of honor opposite the doorway I
could make out only a few of the silent figures of Royanehs
and chieftains sitting in concentric circles around the pit
in which burned the tribal Council Fire of the Senecas.
But as I watched, the direct rays of the sun crept over the
earthen threshold, and Donehogaweh, sitting at my left,
extended his sinewy arm and dropped a handful of tobacco
leaves upon the smoldering coals in the fire-pit.  A single
column of smoke, hazily blue, rose straight in the air, and
the acrid odor of the tobacco permeated the room.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Hawenneyo," intoned the Guardian of the Western
Door, "and you, Tharon, the Sky-holder, and Heno, Master
of the Thunder, and Gaoh, Lord of the Winds, you too, oh,
Three Sisters of the Deohako, Our Supporters, and the
Honochenokeh, Aids of the Great Spirit and Ministers of
his Mercy, heed our prayer!  Open your ears to the words
we send you by the smoke which rises from our Council
Fire!"
</p>

<p>
He cast aside his skin robe of ceremony, and stood erect
in his place, naked except for breechclout and moccasins,
his gaunt body as straight as a youth's, his voice ringing
with the virility that defies age.  He folded his arms upon
his chest.  His face was raised to the smoke-hole in the
roof.
</p>

<p>
"We are sending forth upon a journey three of our
young men.  They have far to go.  It may be that they will
trespass upon forbidden ground.  We beseech that you will
deal gently with them.  If they may go no further, turn
their steps aside, and lead them elsewhere.  They are not
foolishly curious.  They seek to redress a wrong and to
learn what is in store for their people.  That is all.
</p>

<p>
"We show them to you, now, before the people."
</p>

<p>
He signaled me to rise, and I swung food-bags in place
and stood beside him, leaning on my musket.
</p>

<p>
"This is Otetiani, my white son.  He is a brave warrior,
Oh, Hawenneyu.  His mind is clouded by a great sorrow.
Take it from him, and let him return to live out his life
in comfort."
</p>

<p>
Corlaer rose.
</p>

<p>
"This is Corlaer, my white brother.  He is a big man, oh,
Hawenneyu, and he has a big belly.  But if his strength is
great, he can subdue his hunger.  He is a good friend and
a terrible enemy."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears rose.
</p>

<p>
"This is Tawannears, born of the Clan of the Wolf, Warden
of the Door.  He is the son of my sister.  In him flows
all that is left of my blood.  He goes to fill an empty place
in his heart.  If it be wise, oh, Hawenneyu, grant him what
he seeks.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Na-ho!</i>"
</p>

<p>
And from the circles of indistinct figures came a
muttered chorus&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Yo-hay!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Donehogaweh turned to us as we stood by the fire-pit
whence the smoke had ceased to rise.
</p>

<p>
"You are going upon a long journey," he said gravely.
"Perhaps many enemies will assail you.  Perhaps you will
know great danger.  Perhaps you will be faced by death.
But I charge you, do not show fear.  If you return with
the scalps of all who oppose you, we will be proud of you.
We will dance for you the Wasaseh, the War Dance.  If
you do not return at all, we will remember you, and the
women shall teach the children to honor your memories.
But do not return to us unless you can boast of all that
you have done, and be ashamed of nothing.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Na-ho!</i>"
</p>

<p>
He caught up his skin-robe and draped it around his
shoulders as he led us from the Council House, the
assemblage of Royanehs and chiefs crowding after us through
the narrow door.  In the flat, hard-beaten Dancing Place
outside, the center of the wide-spreading Seneca village of
Deonundagaa, stood hundreds of warriors, women, and
leaping, scrambling children.  They stretched from the
door to the gaondote, or war-post, its charred, splintered
stump rising in the center of the open space, around
which were ranked the ganasotes, or Long Houses, in which
the people dwelt, and from which they took their name.
</p>

<p>
Most of them were only idly curious, friendly, but
with no personal interest.  But many who knew us
pressed forward for a last, informal word before we
left.  Guanaea, wife of Donehogaweh&mdash;I dislike the
debased word squaw, which is inept for a people like the
Iroquois, who rate their women far higher than we
do&mdash;snatched at my hand, her kindly, capable glance examining
my equipment.  The deerskin garments I wore had been
fashioned by her.  She had prepared the provender of
jerked meat and mixed charred corn and maple-sugar
which filled my food-bags.  She had contrived my barken
box of coarse salt.  And she had done as much for
Tawannears and Corlaer, too.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, Otetiani, my white son," she said, with tears
in her eyes.  "May Hawenneyu have you in his keeping!
I have no son of my body to tell me brave tales of what he
has done, and you know that you are doubly dear to me.
You must do as Tawannears and Corlaer when the snow
flies and rub yourself with bear's grease.  It is good at all
times, and you should learn to like it.  And do not bathe
so often.  Hanegoategeh, the Evil Spirit, is always on the
watch to send ills to those who rub their skins.  But here!"
</p>

<p>
She took a small pouch of deerskin from her breast and
hung it around my neck by a strip of rawhide.
</p>

<p>
"That will protect you against all evils!  Keep it always
on you."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" I asked, slipping it inside my leather shirt.
</p>

<p>
"A most powerful Orenda," she whispered mysteriously.
"I had it made by Hineogetah, the Medicine Man.  It is
proof against spirits and bullets.  It will turn a
scalping-knife and resist a tomahawk."
</p>

<p>
"But what is it?" I persisted.
</p>

<p>
She looked around to make sure that nobody was within
hearing distance.  Donehogaweh was holding a final
discussion with Tawannears, and the interest of the crowd
was concentrated upon them.
</p>

<p>
"The fang of a bull rattlesnake," she said, ticking the
items off on her fingers.  "That is the spirit to resist evil.
The eye-tooth of a wolf that was slain by Sonosowa of the
Turtle Clan, for, of course, no Wolf could slay a wolf, in
act of making his kill.  That is the spirit to resist courage.
A coal from the Ever-burning Fire at Onondago.  That is
the spirit to resist disease.  It is the most powerful Orenda
that Hineogetah has ever made, and I pray that it will keep
you safe, for I think you will need it, Otetiani, a white
man venturing into the Land of Lost Souls, where the
wrath of Tharon may fall at any moment."
</p>

<p>
"But what of Corlaer?" I asked, amused as well as
touched by this essentially feminine point of view.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he is different!" she said.
</p>

<p>
I would have said more to her, but Tawannears turned
from his uncle and slung his furled buckskin shirt across
his naked shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Come, brother," he called to me.  "We must go."
</p>

<p>
I stooped quickly and kissed Guanaea on her wrinkled
cheek.  She drew back, startled, and raised her hand to the
spot my lips had touched.
</p>

<p>
"What is that, Otetiani?" she asked, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"It is the way a white son salutes his mother," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"Do it again," she commanded.
</p>

<p>
I did, to the stern amusement of Donehogaweh and his
attendant Royanehs.
</p>

<p>
"I like it," she said.  "It is a good son who gives his
mother such pleasure.  Surely, Hawenneyu will send you
back to me."
</p>

<p>
"If his Orenda is strong and his valor great, he will
return," declared Donehogaweh.  "But there has been
enough of leavetaking.  A warrior's strength should not
be sapped by sorrow before he takes the war-trail.  Good-by,
Otetiani, my son.  Good-by, Corlaer, my brother.  Good-by,
Tawannears, son of my sister.  We await your return
with honor."
</p>

<p>
He raised his right arm in the gesture of farewell.  A
thicket of arms sprang up in the Dancing Place and we
acknowledged the salute in kind.  Then, without a word,
Tawannears turned his back and walked southward through
the village.  I walked after him, and Corlaer came behind
me.  Not a voice was raised to shout after us.  Not a call
came from the surrounding houses.  I looked back once&mdash;as
no Indian would have done&mdash;and saw the assemblage
standing immobile, Donehogaweh, with his robe wrapped
around him, his eyes fastened upon us, his face emotionless.
Even Guanaea stood now like a statue.  Then we came to
the forest wall, and Deonundagaa became a thing of roof-tops,
occasionally glimpsed through the thickening screen
of greenery.
</p>

<p>
The trail was the usual Indian footway, a stamped-out
slot, a groove just wide enough for a man to pass,
worn in the floor and hacked through the body of the
wilderness.  We traversed it in silence, each, I suppose,
immersed in his thoughts.  For the most part, I fixed my
eyes upon the sliding muscles of Tawannears' back, rippling
so smoothly under his oiled skin, his effortless stride
carrying him ahead at a steady dog-trot.  Behind me I
could hear the grunting of Corlaer and the crackle of
branches his broad shoulders pushed against&mdash;and by that
I knew that we were in absolutely safe country, for the big
Dutchman could be as quiet and as agile with his
mountainous bulk as Tawannears, himself.
</p>

<p>
My mind turned to the day, three weeks past, that
these two had reëntered my life, after years of separation,
and lifted me at once by the clean ardor of their personalities
out of the miasma of sickening thoughts in which grief
had immersed me.
</p>

<p>
Much had happened since then.  Hasty adjustments of
my business; last-minute conferences with the governor
and several merchants, members of his Council, who had
generously volunteered to take over the conduct of my
affairs; drilling of John Allen in various niceties of the
situation; the voyage up Hudson's River by sloop to
Albany, huddled under the protection of Fort Orange below
the mouth of the Mohawk, our main outpost on the frontier;
a fortnight on the Great Trail of the Long House; flitting
meetings with old friends; the aroma of the forest; longer
and longer hours of sleep; Deonundagaa and&mdash;this.
</p>

<p>
I tossed back my head and inhaled the scent of the wild
grapevine that twisted around a giant oak, and my eyes
took joy from the mottling of the sunlight drifting through
foliage a hundred feet overhead and the scuttling of a
rabbit across the trail.  We passed a beaver-pond, and I drew
a lesson in steadfast courage from the tireless endurance of
these small creatures, forever building and never dismayed
by the most arduous undertaking.
</p>

<p>
Three weeks!  And already I saw myself in prospect of a
whole man again.  I straightened with the thought, and
took pride in my instant ability to adjust myself to the
Indian's trail pace.  Tawannears gave me a quick smile
over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"My brother's heart is glad," he said.  "I can tell by
the lightness of his step."
</p>

<p>
"Truly, I feel as I had never thought to feel again," I
returned.  "Who would choose to live in a town if he
might roam the forest at will?  And the day is passing
fair."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oof!</i>" grunted Corlaer behind me.  "It grows hot."
</p>

<p>
We made thirty miles that day, and camped with some
Seneca hunters who shared their fresh venison with us.  In
the morning we continued on our way, still heading south
for the headwaters of the Alleghany River.
</p>

<p>
"For the route we take," said Tawannears, in discussing
the journey, "the word of my brother Otetiani shall be
law.  He has a mission to perform for Gaengwarago.  But
if you will listen to me you will strike south to the
Alleghany, and follow that into the Ohio, which, in turn, flows
into the Great River that my people call the Father of
Waters.  This way, brother, we shall fetch a wide compass
around the French post at Detroit, and come near enough
Vincennes for you to look at it if you wish.  But it will be
better for you if the French do not see you or hear of your
mission."
</p>

<p>
"That is true," I admitted.  "But for your plan we
must have a canoe."
</p>

<p>
"I can find one," he answered readily.  "I cached it on
the Alleghany the last time I returned from an embassy
to the Creeks."
</p>

<p>
We settled our route according to Tawannears' advice.
Traveling by water, as he also pointed out, meant on the
whole a much better rate of progress than land travel, and
likewise made it unnecessary for us to traverse so many
tribal ranges.  Tawannears, as a war chief of the Iroquois,
was fairly certain of respectful treatment at the hands of
any well-known tribe north of the Ohio and east of the
Mississippi.  But many of these Indians had fallen under
the influence of the French, and it was questionable what
attitude they might adopt if they discovered who I was.
It was safest for all concerned to pass as swiftly and quietly
as possible through the country this side of the Mississippi.
We have nothing to gain by lingering, and perhaps
everything to lose.
</p>

<p>
The second day we had no beaten trail to aid us, and
a cold rain pelted from the east.  The country was seamed
with shallow ravines and gulleys, and at intervals we came
to dense belts of undergrowth, spurred with thorns and
bound together by vines and creepers.  Sometimes we circled
these patches.  Sometimes we hacked a path with our
war-hatchets.  We were exhausted when night fell, and
welcomed the shelter offered us by a party of wandering
Mohicans; but in the morning we took up the trail, despite
the recurring rain.  Slippery rocks and ankle-deep mud
delayed us.  The coarse grass of the occasional swales was
treacherous underfoot.  But we kept on.  And I was amazed
to discover that the weather had no effect upon my spirits.
I enjoyed the independence of it, the sopping foliage, the
persistent drip-drip of the rain, the fatigue that strained
every muscle.  More than all I enjoyed our third camp
beneath a bark lean-to hastily contrived.  The roof leaked;
our fire lasted barely long enough to cook the wild turkey
our Mohican hosts had given us; and I was soaked to the
skin.  Yet I slept through the night to awaken alert and
refreshed in the bright dawning of a new day.
</p>

<p>
In the forenoon Tawannears made his landfall on a tiny
creek that fed the headwaters of the Alleghany.  We
reached the main stream in mid-afternoon, and with one
curt glance around, he walked straight to a grass-covered
indentation in the bank.
</p>

<p>
"Here is the canoe, brothers," he said casually.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nein</i>," Corlaer, without moving from where he stood,
his little eyes fixed on the hiding-place.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears drew back from the edge of the inlet, a
startled look on his usually blank face.
</p>

<p>
"Here I left it, well-concealed," he insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Smoke, down-rifer," remarked the Dutchman.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears and I shifted our gaze.  The Seneca's eyes
reflected a momentary expression of chagrin that he should
not have been the first to mark this sign.
</p>

<p>
"We will go to it," he announced briefly.  "This land is
tributary to the Long House.  We shall see who is bold
enough to take the canoe of a chief of the Long House from
the threshold of the Western Door."
</p>

<p>
Of course, he was speaking figuratively, for we were a
long three days' tramping from Deonundagaa; but it was a
striking manifestation of the proud arrogance of the
Iroquois that Tawannears, an Indian to his backbone, insisted
upon walking directly into that encampment, without going
to the preliminaries of scouting the strange community.
</p>

<p>
A half-grown boy sighted us through the trees while
we were still some distance away, and his shrill cries
gave the alarm.  As we stepped from the edge of
the forest, a dozen men grouped in front of the four bark
shelters that stood just back from the bank.  In the offing
I perceived half as many women and some children.  They
were a dark, stumpy people, with low-browed, brutish faces.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears frowned and pointed to a canoe drawn up
on the bank.
</p>

<p>
"Andastes," he spat contemptuously.  "They are dogs
and thieves who have no right here.  The Hoyarnagowar
has bidden them range in the Susquehanna Valley."
</p>

<p>
Musket in the hollow of his arm, he marched into the
center of the dour group, every member of which clutched
a fusil, trade musket or strung bow.
</p>

<p>
"Andastes," he said, "you have taken my canoe."
</p>

<p>
"We have only our own canoe," answered a thick-limbed
warrior, who was out-thrust from the dingy throng.
</p>

<p>
"I say it is mine," returned Tawannears with haughty
emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"You are welcome to camp here if you wish; we will
give you food," said the Andaste evasively.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears' eyes sparked fire.
</p>

<p>
"Dog of an Andaste!" he barked.  "Who are you to
speak as a master to the Hodenosaunee?  You crawl when
the word comes to you from Onondaga!  You eat dirt if a
warrior of the Long House commands it!  You are the
fathers of all lice!"
</p>

<p>
The Andastes scowled and bunched closer together, with
a tentative poising of weapons.  Tawannears drew his
tomahawk and held it aloft.
</p>

<p>
"I am Tawannears, Warden of the Western Door," he
said slowly.  "I am fresh come from Deonundagaa.  Say
which it is to be, Andastes, peace or war?"
</p>

<p>
They shrank away from him.  All save two or three
disappeared into the lodges or the forest.  But they had no
thought of violence.  The heart was taken out of them.
Tawannears was more than Tawannears.  He was the
embodiment of that dread power which these inferior savages
knew could carry annihilation in any direction and almost
to any distance north, south and west.  He stood there, ax
upraised, the spirit of the Long House, which even the
white men feared.
</p>

<p>
The Andaste chief lowered his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"We do not want war," he answered.  "Take the canoe.
We found it.  We did not know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You know that you have no rights here," Tawannears
cut him off.  "This is the hunting ground of the Long
House.  Here, too, may come Mohicans, Eries and the
People of the Cat.*  But Andastes belong in the Susquehanna
valley.  Get back there.  If I find you here when I
pass this way again, I will carry fire and tomahawk against
you and all your people."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Jegosasa, sometimes called Neuter Nation.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He turned on his heel, and with a gesture to us, stalked
down to the shore and pushed the canoe into the water.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go on, brothers," he urged.  "Here the air is
unclean."
</p>

<p>
He took the bow paddle, and I crouched amidships.
Corlaer, gentle as a girl for all his bulk, slipped gingerly
into the stern.  Their blades bit into the shallow water, and
under the impulse of those slow, easy strokes, the light craft
fairly danced downstream, gaining speed as it caught the
drift of the current.  We rounded a curve, and the Andaste
encampment disappeared from view.
</p>

<p>
"Will they obey you?" I asked Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
He laughed shortly.
</p>

<p>
"They will be gone before the sun rises again, brother
Otetiani.  They know well that they have no right there,
but the place is out of the way and far from the Door,
and they thought they would be safe.  They are a nation
of women.  We do not even let them fight for us."
</p>

<p>
Paddling was very different work from wood-ranging,
and we made ten miles before darkness compelled
us to land on a miniature island and pitch
camp in the lee of a big rock.  We had a small fire so
arranged that its glow could not be seen from either shore,
and beside it we slept under the stars.  With the dawn we
were up and afloat once more, munching the burnt corn and
maple-sugar from our food-sacks.
</p>

<p>
This day I observed that Tawannears seemed to redouble
his vigilance.  From his position in the bow he studied the
shore-line constantly, and in the afternoon he halted an
hour before daylight failed, to take advantage of an
opportunity to camp upon another island.
</p>

<p>
"Why so careful?" I grumbled.  "Do you think these
Andastes may be tracking us, after all!"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"No, brother, but we are entering a country where the
Long House is feared, but where its word is no longer law.
Anywhere here we may meet bands of young warriors of
a score of tribes who have taken advantage of the Spring
hunting to look for their first scalps.  They would see in
us only three victims for killing."
</p>

<p>
But despite&mdash;or it may be because of&mdash;our vigilance, we
saw no trace of other men, save once when making a portage
around some rapids.  As we were in the act of relaunching
our canoe three other craft, each containing three red
warriors, rounded the next bend downstream.  We waited for
them, arms ready.  But they made the sign of peaceful
intent as they approached, and we held our fire.  They were
Cherokees, fine, tall men, very much like the Iroquois, and
they told us frankly that they were an embassy carrying
belts to Detroit They said their people were having
trouble with the colonists in the Carolinas and they desired
to take steps to establish an alliance with the French.
</p>

<p>
"The French are no different from the English, brothers,"
replied Tawannears.  "They are both Asseroni.*  They
are both white.  We are red.  There are white men
who understand the Indian.  Two are my brothers here.
But they have few among their race who agree with them.
You go upon a hopeless errand.  The French will make
you promises.  They will give you arms, and use you when
it suits their ends, and when they have no use for you they
will let you go to the stake."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Ax-makers.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Cherokees, squatting in a half-circle on the shore
facing us and the beached canoes, exchanged uneasy glances.
</p>

<p>
"Then what does our brother of the Hodenosaunee advise?"
asked the oldest chief.  "What policy do his people
pursue to uphold themselves?  They are directly between
French and English.  If there is no help from one or the
other, what is the Indian to do?"
</p>

<p>
"The Hodenosaunee maintain their place by strength,"
replied Tawannears.  "They have made their help worthwhile
to the English.  But the time will come, brothers,
when the English will no longer need us, when the white
man's firewater has debauched our young men, when so
many white men have come over the Great Water that they
will outnumber the Indian.  Then the Indian must go."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" demanded the Cherokee.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears waved his arm down-stream.
</p>

<p>
"Brothers," he said, "I journey to find what lies betwixt
this and the sunset&mdash;and beyond.  It may be that Hawenneyu
has set aside a country for the red man that the white
man cannot take."
</p>

<p>
"If the red man gives ground forever, then surely the
white man will drive him out," declared the Cherokee.
</p>

<p>
"True," agreed Tawannears.  "And if the red men
united together, the white man could never drive them out.
Your brothers, the Tuscaroras, came north in my father's
time, driven from their homes by the same white men who
now harass you.  We of the Hodenosaunee took them into
our League, and now they are safe.  The walls of the Long
House protect them.  Perhaps the Hoyarnagowar would
decree a lengthening of the walls if the Cherokees desired
to enter the League."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, as younger brothers to sit outside the Fire Circle,
without casting votes in the Council of Royanehs," returned
the Cherokee with passionate emphasis.  "That is
what happened to the Tuscaroras.  They are dependents
of the Hodenosaunee.  We Cherokees are a great people.
Shall we lose ourselves in the fabric of the Long House?"
</p>

<p>
Tawannears emptied the ashes from his pipe and rose.
</p>

<p>
"My brother has pointed the reason why the red man
cannot stand against the white man," he said quietly.
"Outside of the Long House the powerful tribes will not
hold together.  The Hodenosaunee can conquer people like
the Eries or the Mohicans, but we see no interest in
conquering the Cherokees&mdash;and if we did not conquer you,
you would not join with us."
</p>

<p>
"Because we might not join you as equals!" the Cherokee
retorted hotly.
</p>

<p>
"There is no question of equality or inequality," asserted
Tawannears.  "But the Founders of the Great League
created only so many Royanehs, and we who follow in their
footsteps may not correct their work.  Go to Onondaga
with your belts, and Tododaho, the greatest of our
Royanehs, who warms his mind by the Everlasting Fire, will
make your hearts strong with wise talk.  Let him tell you,
better than I can, how to unite for strength."
</p>

<p>
The Cherokee rose with a stern light of resentment in
his face.
</p>

<p>
"We go to Detroit," he said.  "Better be allies of the
Frenchman, and play one race of white man against the
other, than be slaves of the Hodenosaunee."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears did not answer him and was silent until we
had paddled an hour or more.
</p>

<p>
"What did you think of our talk, brother Otetiani?" he
asked suddenly, peering over his shoulder at me.
</p>

<p>
"I thought that you were right," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"I am so sure I am right that I can see the whole future
of the red man," he cried.  "He will perish because he
cannot break down his tribal barriers."
</p>

<p>
"Der Frenchman, too," spoke up Corlaer behind me.
</p>

<p>
I turned in mingled amusement and surprise.  It was
seldom he used more than monosyllables.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," he continued, "der Englishman, he takes in all,
Dutch, Swede, Cherman, Frenchman.  But der Frenchman,
he is der Frenchman.  Der Englishman he comes on top.
He-mixes.  <i>Ja</i>."

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
THE SHAWNEE SCALP-HUNTER
</h3>

<p>
Day after day we descended the broadening river.
Once a floating snag ripped our bottom out, and
we swam to shore, pushing the sodden craft ahead
of us.  Tawannears cut bark strips, melted pitch I collected
from the pine trees, and salvaged the sinews of a deer he
shot with the bow and arrow he carried for hunting game.
With these he mended the hole and made it water-tight, and
after two days' delay we continued our journey, thankful
to have escaped attack whilst we tarried in this situation,
for our spare powder had been wetted.
</p>

<p>
Treacherous channels and difficult portages hindered us
further, but each day saw some advance to our credit, and
at last we came to the place which Tawannears called the
Meeting of the Waters.  We were swept by a rapid current
around the shoulder of a point just before sunset, and
there opened before us two other watery prospects.  At
our left another stream, the Monongahela, poured in from
the south to join its flow with the Allegheny, and the two
united to form the great Ohio.
</p>

<p>
'Twas a matchless situation.  North, south and west ran
the three rivers, roads already laid to tap the resources of
the wilderness.  At their confluence was the ideal site for the
erection of a fortress to command their courses and dominate
the wilderness for miles around.  Indeed, I remember
long years afterward&mdash;I think it was in the year
'60&mdash;young Colonel Washington of Virginia, when he was in
New York in attendance on General Amherst, told me 'twas
here the great French General Montcalm settled to build
Fort Duquesne, which was one of the causes of the last
struggle for the wilderness land.  I remember, too, he said
in his grave, simple way, that it should yet be the site of a
prosperous town.
</p>

<p>
We camped that night on the point, the murmur of the
waters in Spring freshet loud in our ears, and in the
morning we allowed our canoe to be carried into the brawling
current of the Ohio.  So swift flowed this mighty stream
that we had no necessity to use our paddles, save to guide
the canoe from rocks and maintain it in the safest
channel.  We traveled as far that day as we often had in two
days on the Allegheny's more tortuous reaches.  But there
came days when we must be at pains to avoid hidden
dangers; when the waters foamed with rocks and
submerged bars, and immense trees were hurled along like
battering-rams to sink the over-confident.  Sometimes
we were fain to avoid over-dangerous bits, and stumbled
along the shore-line in shallow water, the canoe on our
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
I marveled that we saw so little human life.  Occasionally
a canoe would dart into the bank at sight of our approach,
its occupant seeking shelter in the undergrowth.  Twice an
attempt was made by other canoes to overhaul us, but I
was able now to lend my arms to assist Tawannears and
Peter, and we left the pursuers far behind.  Again, where
the Scioto falls into the Ohio from the north, we encountered
a party of Miamis bound south on an impartial hunt
for scalps and buffalo robes.  They knew Tawannears, and
treated us with all respect.  But for the most part the river
flowed undisturbed on its majestic way to mingle with the
Father of Waters.
</p>

<p>
For days and days we saw no other men.  Not even a
spiral of smoke rose from the dark forests that marched
unbroken down to the shelving banks or the bluffs and hills
that elsewhere rimmed the channel.
</p>

<p>
Then, without warning, came the attack.
</p>

<p>
The stream had narrowed between low banks, and a riffle
of rocks on the north side compelled us to follow the
southern margin.
</p>

<p>
A shot boomed from the southern bank, and I heard it
whistle by my head.  Other shots echoed it.  We all looked
around.  Puffs of smoke were blowing from the underbrush.
The shrill howl of the warwhoop soared in quavering accents
above the babble of the river.  Painted men, feathers
raking from their half-shaven heads, broke cover and ran
along after us, firing and yelling.  Two long canoes shoved
off from the bank, and churned the water with four paddles
apiece.  In the bow of each knelt a savage whose one object
was to shoot us down.  Bullets phutted through the frail
bark sides of the canoe and splashed the water all around
us.
</p>

<p>
"Shawnees!" exclaimed Tawannears.  "For your lives,
brothers!"
</p>

<p>
We drove our paddles into the water, but our handicap
was that we could not veer more than just so far toward the
northern bank until we had passed the string of rocks that
barred it.  We were still some distance above the termination
of the obstruction when a jagged slug of lead tore into
the canoe between Tawannears and me, glanced from a hickory
thwart, and sliced a long, curving slit in the side below
the water-line; I dropped my paddle, and clutched the lips
of the cut with both hands, one outside and one inside the
canoe, striving to hold them together as best I could.  The
water trickled in, of course, and as the canoe sank under its
growing weight it became increasingly difficult to control
the leak; but at least we were able to make some progress.
</p>

<p>
"Good, brother!" panted Tawannears, seeing what I was
doing.  "A few feet more!"
</p>

<p>
The Shawnees howled with satisfaction as they perceived
our plight.  Their canoes shot after us at twice our speed,
and some of the warriors on the southern bank plunged
into the river where it was narrowest, and swam for the
rock-ledge, whence they could wade to the northern bank.
But Tawannears and Corlaer kept us afloat until we were
almost past the rock-ledge.  'Twas I saw the wavelet that
would swamp us, and I shouted a warning to the others.
We held powder-horns and rifles aloft and sprang for the
nearest rocks.
</p>

<p>
I went head under and barely saved my powder
from a second wetting.  Tawannears and Peter found
footing at once, and the huge Dutchman helped me
up beside them.  Then we stumbled through the water as
fast as the hazardous rocks permitted, zigzagging and stooping
low to disconcert the enemies who fired on us from the
opposite bank and the two canoes, which drove on downstream
to seek a favorable landing-place.  The Shawnees
who had undertaken to swim the river were already ashore
several hundred yards upstream and running towards us
along the bank, and it was at them that we fired as soon as
we had gained the first trees of the forest.
</p>

<p>
We were panting from our efforts, but Tawannears
hit a man in the leg.  Corlaer drilled his target
through the chest.  I missed.  But our firing had
the effect of confusing the pursuit.  Instead of charging
in the open, they dived into the forest in an attempt to
work down on us from behind.  But we sensed their purpose,
and tarried only long enough to reload.  With Tawannears
in the lead, we set off northward, making no attempt
to conceal our trail, for we had no time for niceties.  The
whoops of the swimmers could be heard on our right rear,
and answering calls came from the warriors who had
debarked from the canoes on our left.  Through the
tree-trunks we could see some ten or a dozen more taking to
the water from the south bank.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, the forest hereabouts was a wondrous
primeval growth of tall-stemmed, widely-spaced trunks.
There was little underbrush, and the ground was carpeted
with a deep, springy layer of vegetable mould, the easiest
footing for a runner.  The light was sifted high overhead
by the interlacing boughs, and it was impossible to see
distinctly at any distance.  The odds seemed reasonably in
our favor, despite the continuous whooping at our heels,
and I was amazed when Tawannears came to an abrupt halt
after we had run a scant half-hour.
</p>

<p>
"They will be scattered," he said in explanation to my
look of inquiry.  "We will teach them that they are not
dealing with young deer-hunters like themselves.  Do you
run on a score of strides, Otetiani, and Corlaer as many
more.  I will fire when I see a target, and flee.  Then you
will each fire in turn, and run.  That way the two in the
rear will have had time to reload.  Come, brothers, we will
scotch these young men who think our scalps as easy to
take as a deer's antlers."
</p>

<p>
Corlaer grunted approval, and we two held to our course.
I halted behind a great oak from which I could barely
discern the figure of Tawannears lurking behind an
uprooted elm.  Five minutes passed.  The yelping of our
enemies had died away.  Young hounds they might be,
but it was in their blood to save breath once they had their
noses on a green trail.  Suddenly, I saw a stab of flame in
the gloom, and Tawannears darted toward me, musket in
hand.  The crash of his shot was followed by a yelp of
agony, and once more the silence of the forest reëchoed
the eerie war-whoop.
</p>

<p>
"Watch carefully, brother," the Seneca muttered as he
loped past.
</p>

<p>
I lifted my musket and waited, eyes darting right and
left, striving to pierce the depths of the shadow-world that
was unflecked by a single ray of sunlight.  I stared so long
that my eye muscles wearied, and the lids blinked.  I
closed them for a moment's rest, and when I reopened
them the first thing I was conscious of seeing was a shadow
darker than the shadows, that flitted between two tree-trunks
on my left.  He was so close that I thought I must
have been deceived, but whilst I watched he showed again,
and I made out the slanting feather above his crouching
form.  I aimed a good foot below the feather, and pulled
trigger.  The Shawnee leaped high in air, with a throttled
cry, and pitched forward on his face.  I ran.
</p>

<p>
"Goodt," murmured Corlaer, huddled behind a boulder
that showed moss-covered amongst the timber.
</p>

<p>
I sped on, and halted only when Tawannears' low voice
reached my ears.
</p>

<p>
"Reload," he said briefly.  "We must run again when
Corlaer comes.  The dogs are swifter than I thought.
Hear them!"
</p>

<p>
He inclined his ear to the left rear, and I heard distinctly
the interchange of signal-yells, once even a distant
crashing of branches.  The Shawnees were working around
in an attempt to head us off.  I was relieved when Corlaer'a
musket boomed, and the Dutchman's huge body bounded
into view.  He ran as lightly as he did everything else.
The man was a swift runner who could keep up with him.
</p>

<p>
"Now, speed, brothers," said Tawannears.  "The next
effort tells."
</p>

<p>
We ran as I had seldom run before, not fast and slow,
but faster and ever faster, with every ounce of strength
and wind.  The yelps of the Shawnees died away behind us
again, and I think we had distanced them when we emerged
from the forest gloom into a belt of sunshine several miles
wide.  One of those awful wind-storms, to which the New
World is exposed, had come this way, and wreaked its
curious spite by striking down everything in its immediate
front.  As clean as a knife-blade it had hewed its path,
leaving miles of prostrate timber where formerly had been
a lordly forest.  And across this natural abattis we must
make our way in the open!
</p>

<p>
There was nothing else for it, and we plunged in, climbing
in and out of the wreckage, seldom able to go faster
than a walk.  We were a scant musket-shot from the forest
edge when the Shawnees appeared and howled their glee.
They could not gain on us, but they were uncomfortably
close as we entered the standing timber on the far side of
the dead-fall; and we knew that we could not run much
farther.  My eyes were starting from my head as we
dipped into a shallow glade that was threaded by a deep
and narrow stream.  Boulders dotted its course.  Ten
yards away an immense tulip-tree overhung it.
</p>

<p>
I flung myself down for a quick drink, thinking to hurry
on.  But on regaining my feet I saw Tawannears in close
debate with Corlaer.  The Dutchman nodded his head, and
dropped into the water, which was up to his middle.  I
made to follow him, but Tawannears motioned me to hold
my position, peering the while at our back-trail, alert for
a sign of our enemies.  I stared from him to Corlaer in
growing amazement.  The Dutchman clambered up the
opposite bank and tramped heavily to a series of stones and
small boulders.  He planted his wet, muddy moccasins on
the first stones, then carefully walked backward in his
own footsteps into the river and recrossed to our side.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Tawannears, and he dropped into the
river-bed besides Corlaer.
</p>

<p>
Perforce, I followed suit, wondering what mad scheme
they were up to.
</p>

<p>
The Seneca led us downstream into the shadow of the
tulip-tree.  Here the creek overran a flat stone, which came
just to water-level.  Tawannears stepped onto it, handed
his musket to me, caught hold of a low tree-branch and
in a trice had swung himself onto the limb.  I reached
him our three guns, and whilst he worked back toward
the trunk, holding them under one arm, I scrambled up
beside him.  Corlaer came after me, his weight bearing the
limb down almost to the water's surface, so that for an
instant I thought it must break.  But the resilient wood
upheld him, and we all three gained the crotch of the
fifteen-foot bole.  There was ample room, and the thick
leafage gave us cover as we settled ourselves to see what the
Shawnees would make of the lure we had set for them.
</p>

<p>
Nothing happened for so long that I wondered whether
they had seen through the ruse, and were plotting to catch
us in our lair.  But presently a feathered head was
advanced from the low-growing foliage of the bank and
studied the footprints Corlaer had trampled on the farther
bank.  A fierce painted face was turned toward us momentarily.
Then the lean body, clad only in breachclout and
moccasins, slipped into the water without a ripple and
waded across.  The Shawnee crept up the bank until he
came to the prints of the Dutchman's wet feet on the stones.
At that he turned, with a quick gesture of command, and a
string of savage figures dodged after him.  We counted
thirty-one, most of them armed with muskets.  They
disappeared into the woods on the opposite bank at a fast
dog-trot.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears dropped from the tulip-tree without a word.
</p>

<p>
"Where now?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
He smiled.  Never let anyone tell you the Indian has no
sense of humor.
</p>

<p>
"Why, we need a new canoe, brother; and the Shawnees
have left two waiting for us on the river-shore."
</p>

<p>
Behind us Corlaer gave vent to a squeak of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>, we put der choke on dem deer-hunters!  Haw!"
</p>

<p>
We retraced our steps as rapidly as we had come, and
because we now knew the way, we were able to cross the
area of fallen timber in half the time we had taken formerly.
But we were still within musket-shot of the forest-edge
when the war-whoop resounded behind us, and a
dozen Shawnees broke from cover.
</p>

<p>
"They are good warriors," approved Tawannears.
"When they failed to pick up our trail again beyond the
boulders they turned back."
</p>

<p>
"Shall we wait to welcome them?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"No, brother.  We have nothing to gain by killing them.
We need a canoe, not scalps."
</p>

<p>
So we ran on toward the river, although how Tawannears
so unerringly picked his way I cannot say.  'Twas
not so much that he knew the direction of the river.  I
could have done as much.  But rather that he knew by
instinct the shortest, most direct route to follow.  We burst
from the forest's edge a half-musket shot from where the
canoes of the Shawnees were beached.  Two men who had
been left on guard over them, one the warrior Tawannears
had shot in the leg in our first brush, rose to welcome us, at
first, no doubt, thinking us to be their friends.  But when
they saw who we were they raised their bows and loosed
a brace of arrows at us.  Corlaer shot the wounded man
offhand, and Tawannears bounded in to close quarters and
brained the other with his tomahawk.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ha-yah-yak-eeeee-eeee-eee-ee-e!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The scalp-yell of the Iroquois rolled from shore to shore
with the dreadful, shrill vehemence of the catamount's
bawl.  A defiant answer came from our Shawnee pursuers
not so far behind us.  Tawannears stuffed his victim's
scalp into his waist-belt, and flailed the bottom out of one
of the canoes with his bloody tomahawk, then shoved the
ruined craft out into the stream to sink.
</p>

<p>
"Ready, brothers," he called, pushing the undamaged
canoe afloat.  "We must be beyond musket-shot when the
Shawnees reach here.  Ha, their hearts will be very sad.
There will be sorrow in their lodges.  But they have learned
that a band of deer-hunters cannot overcome three warriors
who are wily in the chase."
</p>

<p>
We bent to the paddles, and drove the clumsy craft&mdash;'twas
much heavier than the one we had lost&mdash;out into the
current, where we might have the benefit of the river's
drift.  And, fortunately, we were a long shot distant when
the first Shawnees reached the bank.  Several of their
bullets splashed close to us, but they soon abandoned the
waste of powder, and we could hear the ululating howls
by which they sought to recall their absent warriors and
announce our escape.
</p>

<p>
Nightfall found us many miles downstream, but Tawannears
would not suffer us to halt.  Wet to the bone with
sweat and river-water, we paddled on with weary arms
that ached, eyes straining into the darkness to ward against
rock or floating tree-branch.  Near midnight the moon
rose, and we could see the channel distinctly; but this was
another reason for haste, and we did not rest until the
gray dawn light revealed a sandy, brush-covered islet in
midstream.  Here we beached the canoe, hauled it out of
sight, and lay down beside it to sleep like dead men under
the warmth of the sun.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
A MEETING IN THE WILDERNESS
</h3>

<p>
Summer blew up from the South and wrapped
the Wilderness Country in a misty languor.
Our arms lagged at the paddling.  We were
prone to idling back against the thwarts and watching
the vast flocks of birds that flew northward, and
especially the incalculable myriads of the pigeons, flights of
such monstrous proportions that they darkened the sky.
Ay, they shut out the light of the sun, for an hour at
a time, the whirring of their wings and their sharp cries
like the faint echoes of fairy drums and fifes.
</p>

<p>
The forest trees hung heavy with foliage, vividly green,
and the occasional meadows and savannahs were gemmed
with wild-flowers, white and red and yellow and blue and
pink and purple.  The scent of the growing things was
borne to us by the gusty breeze that puffed and died and
puffed again, heavy as the humid air, uncertain,
indeterminate.  At intervals storm-clouds tore down upon
us, black, towering galleons of wrath; there would be
thunder in the heavens; lightning-bolts streaked earthward
to devastate the forest monarchs; and the rain
would spill upon us like the torrents of the Thunder
Waters at Jagara.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Niagara.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
For two weeks we traversed this paradise without
evidence of other men.  Alone we surveyed the area of a
kingdom.  All France, I say, might have been rooted up
and transplanted to this neglected wonderland to which
her King laid inconsequential claim.  Here were timber,
ready for the axe; splendid grazing grounds where only
the deer wandered; endless fields of rich black loam,
awaiting the husbandman.  And the very savages seemed to
have abandoned it.  If any watched us pass, they contrived
to remain unseen.  From horizon to horizon there was not
a curl of smoke to show a human habitation.
</p>

<p>
But there were others besides ourselves on the bosom
of the Ohio, as we soon discovered.  We had slipped by the
mouth of the Ouabache in the night, thinking thus to elude
the observation of a possible picket thrown out from the
French post of Vincennes, although, to say truth, we
saw no trace of such an outpost.  After a few hours' sleep
we were paddling on, encouraged by Tawannears' assertion
that two or three days more should bring us to the
Mississippi, which we regard as the barrier of that ulterior
Wilderness where our real search began, when we rounded
one of the river's frequent bends to face at short range
a fleet of canoes that thronged the stream from shore to
shore.
</p>

<p>
Hard luck could not have dealt us a shrewder stroke.  In
my first glance I spied the trappings of the French Marine
Infantry, the regular troops of the Canadian garrisons,
the glitter of an officer's gorget, and worst of all, the
flutter of the black robe of a priest.  Interspersed with
these were habitants in buckskin and painted Ouabaches,
Miamis and Potawatomis to man the paddles.  There were
fifteen or twenty canoes, varying from slender craft smaller
than ours to larger ones that accommodated six or eight
men.
</p>

<p>
We all three backed water instinctively as we appreciated
the situation, but Tawannears redipped his paddle and
drove forward again almost without a check.
</p>

<p>
"It is useless to flee, brothers," he murmured.  "We
must stand firm."
</p>

<p>
There were several shouts from the fleet ahead, and two
of the smaller craft sped out from their irregular
formation.  Tawannears ceased paddling for an instant and
raised his right arm, palm out, in the signal for peace.
A French officer, in laced coat and cocked hat, in one of
the large canoes answered him in kind, and the Indians
who occupied the two small canoes sheered off as soon
as they descried the wolf's head on his chest.  No ordinary
wood-ranging savages cared to encounter a chief of the
Long House in peace time, even with the backing of French
troops.  They knew their betters, had learned to know
them through many a bloody foray.
</p>

<p>
The French flotilla drifted idly, awaiting us as we
paddled slowly between the leading canoes toward the
one in which was seated the officer who had acknowledged
Tawannears' greeting.
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" I asked, when we came close enough to
identify his corpulent form and massive face.
</p>

<p>
"Charles Le Moyne."
</p>

<p>
"The Chevalier de Longueuil?" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, brother."
</p>

<p>
I stared at the man with increased interest.  He was one
of the four greatest men in Canada, the eldest son and
heir of that Baron de Longueuil who was Lieutenant
Governor.  He ranked next after the Governor-General,
himself, the Intendant and his father.  'Twas no slight
mission had brought him so far from home.
</p>

<p>
I was about to speak again when I noticed a certain
tense rigidity in the muscles that lay in beautiful coils and
ridges along Tawannears' spine.  Simultaneously came a
gasp from Corlaer, behind me in the stern of the canoe.
</p>

<p>
"'Black Robe!'"
</p>

<p>
I craned my neck to peer over the Seneca's head.  Ay,
'twas so.  Behind Le Moyne, sitting as motionless as an
image upon the hard, narrow thwart, his death's-head of
a face turned full upon us was the famous Jesuit, Père
Hyacinthe.  His gnarled tortured fingers were telling the beads
of the rosary that lay across his bony knees.  His black
soutane fell in straight, severe lines to his sandaled feet.  I
knew, though I could not see, the terrible scars that the
torture-stake had left upon his body for once in the past he
had shown them to me.  I knew, too, the man's indomitable
hatred of all things English, his overweening ambition,
fortified by iron will and intense religious conviction, to
win the whole Continent for Louis of France and the
Church of Rome.
</p>

<p>
Of all those who labored with tireless devotion to substitute
Latin civilization for Anglo-Saxon in the New World,
there was none whose aims were more ardently or
unselfishly served.  Up and down the Wilderness Country he
went, always toiling, reckless of hunger, of thirst, of cold,
of physical peril.  And the savages, with their instinct for
the appropriate, had named him Black Robe.  By it he was
known to many thousands who had never seen him.
</p>

<p>
A strange man!  A man whose mentality had been
a little warped by suffering and hardship and over-much
concentration upon ecstatic devotion.  Fasting
and contemplation, loneliness and self-flagellation,
abnegation of all things physical, fire torment and knife
torment&mdash;these had left their mark upon him.  If he did
harm, he also did good.  He was of those fearless ones
who carried the Christian faith to recesses of the
Wilderness which will not be known to others until our sons'
sons push the frontier a thousand leagues nearer to the
sunset.  He believed that he had no occasion to bother
unduly for food, because God would feed him at need, and
certes 'tis true he never died of starvation.  A strange man!
One to be judged without thought to creed or politics.
</p>

<p>
His face betrayed no emotion as our canoe drew alongside
Le Moyne's, and a Marine corporal clutched the gunwale,
but his eyes blazed with fanatical intelligence in the
deep recesses of their bony sockets.  He leaned forward
and tapped Le Moyne's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Anti-Christ is come among us," he announced in sepulchral
tones.  "Here are sons of the English harlot."
</p>

<p>
Le Moyne frowned slightly.  He was a plain soldier-statesman,
and no doubt he found it sometimes difficult
to accept the priest's high ways.  Yet it speaks for Black
Robe's influence that he dared not show resentment.
</p>

<p>
"What mean you, my father?" he asked curtly.
</p>

<p>
The Jesuit pointed an accusing finger at us.
</p>

<p>
"Do you not know them, my son?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Tawannears I know.  'Tis the Warden of the Western
Door of the Long House.  And Corlaer, too, I know.
But not the other."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Henry Ormerod, of the Council of the Governor
of New York, one of the wiliest minions of the English.
He is a renegade from the service of his rightful sovereign
King James, and through him hath held commission from
the Regent Orleans."
</p>

<p>
Of our party I was the only one who could understand
this conversation, for Tawannears and Corlaer had no
French.  It came glibly enough to my tongue, however,
after five years service under the Duke of Berwick on the
frontiers of the Low Countries and Italy and in Spain.
I struck back, therefore, without waiting to consult my
comrades.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis true, Chevalier," I said, "that my name is
Ormerod and Governor Burnet hath honored me with
membership of his Council.  True, too, that in my youth
I was mistaken enough to espouse the cause of the exiled
Stuarts, and thus passed some time in France.  But that
is a page long turned.  Whilst I served James I was faithful,
and I left him because I came to know that he would
never be more than a puppet to serve the ends of a foreign
court.  Since then I have striven to serve my country as
you serve yours.  Is there dishonor and hostility in that?"
</p>

<p>
Le Moyne started to answer me, but Black Robe took
the words from his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Never heed the Englishman," exclaimed the priest.
"He is a servant of evil, a foresworn heretic, an enemy
of France."
</p>

<p>
"There is peace betwixt France and England," I
answered boldly.  "What talk is this of enemies?"
</p>

<p>
The priest tossed his arms aloft.
</p>

<p>
"They talk of peace, peace," he cried.  "And there is
no peace!  Can there ever be peace betwixt anti-Christ
and God?  Nay, my son.  But ask the Englishman what
he does, journeying secretly through the territories of
France hundreds of leagues from English soil.  Why does
he travel with the Iroquois chief who is known as the
principal friend of the English?  Why do we see with
him Corlaer, who is the emissary of the English in seducing
the savages from trading at our posts?  What is his
mission here?  Has he a passport from Quebec?"
</p>

<p>
Le Moyne nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"There you are correct, father.  Monsieur Ormerod,
these questions I must have you answer.  Where is your
passport?"
</p>

<p>
"I have none," I returned.  "Nor do I admit I should
have one.  I have not traveled territory under the control
of France.  Since we left Deonundagaa more than a month
ago we have not seen a single Frenchman or a sign of
French occupation.  More, it is not my purpose to enter
French territory.  I am bound to the farther Wilderness
Country, beyond the Great River."
</p>

<p>
"That, too, is French territory," proclaimed Black Robe.
"All this region God hath set aside for the sons of
France.  No Englishman hath put foot beyond the Great
River."
</p>

<p>
"For that reason, I propose to," I said.  "Surely, there
is no harm in seeking to know what it is like."
</p>

<p>
Le Moyne squared his jaw.
</p>

<p>
"I am not so certain of that, Monsieur Ormerod.  But
'tis useless to debate the point here.  I fear I must ask
you to accompany us to our camping place.  There we will
discuss your case more fully, and endeavor to arrive at
a composition of our differences.  At the worst, I must
send you back to New York under escort.  No harm shall
be done you."
</p>

<p>
There was nothing else for it.  Our plight was hopeless.
We were three against near an hundred Frenchmen and
Indians, and resistance was as unthinkable as flight.
</p>

<p>
So much I reasoned for myself, and Tawannears and
Corlaer agreed with me when I repeated the substance of
the conversation as we fell into line behind the French
commander's canoe, and wearily retraced our course.  We
were too disheartened to say much, for we reckoned it
probable we should have to do over again what we had
already accomplished, and that would mean losing the
Summer&mdash;and very likely, having to wait over the next Winter.
Ahead, I could see Black Robe leaning forward now and
then to speak to Le Moyne.  A bad omen!
</p>

<p>
At dusk the flotilla drew inshore to the northern bank
a few miles below the mouth of the Ouabache, and we
beached our canoe with the others.  A file of the regular
infantry busied themselves to help us collect wood, and
although they did not touch our arms they made us feel
that we were prisoners.  I tried to draw out the corporal,
but gleaned little for my pains.  Yes, they had left Le
Detroit whilst the snow was still on the ground.  They
had been to the mouth of the Great River or very near it,
to the French post at New Orleans, where the Sieur de
Bienville, the Chevalier de Longueuil's brother, was
stationed.  Now, they were returning by way of Vincennes,
Le Detroit, Jagara and Fort Cadaraqui* to Montreal.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Afterward Fort Frontenac.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It had been a trip of inspection, I gathered typical of
the nervous energy of the French Government, not content,
as were the rulers of the English colonies, to rest
satisfied with a strip of seacoast or the valley of a tidal river,
but forever reaching out for new lands to develop and acquire
and hold in fee as a heritage for the future&mdash;a trip
of thousands of leagues by river and forest, under all
extremes of heat and cold.  And if the humble corporal
knew nothing of such high policies, nonetheless I was sure
that one of Le Moyne's objects must have been the selection
of suitable points for a chain of trading stations and
military posts along the line of the Ohio and the Mississippi
to link up the New Orleans settlement with Canada, and
so bar England once for all from the untapped resources
of the Far West beyond the Great River.
</p>

<p>
Somewhat of these reflections I communicated to my
comrades as we ate our evening meal, and we were still
discussing the significance of our chance encounter when an
ensign came to summon us to Le Moyne.  The French
Commander was sitting by a fire in a deep glade that ran
back from the river's brink toward the forest.  Black Robe
was standing beside him when we arrived, hot eyes shining
uncannily in the glare of the leaping flames, distorted
fingers twitching his rosary beads.
</p>

<p>
"Be seated," said Le Moyne briefly.  And then falteringly,
in the Seneca dialect: "Tawannears, and you, Corlaer,
pardon me if I speak in French to your friend.  My
tongue has not the knack of the Iroquois speech."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears bowed with the gracious assent of a prince.
Corlaer squeaked "<i>Ja.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Le Moyne turned to me, his manner hostile, his accent
crisp.
</p>

<p>
"I have been hearing bad things about you, Monsieur
Ormerod.  The reverend father tells me you are a secret
envoy of the English, a spy, in other words, one they send
abroad to sow trouble betwixt us and the savages.  He
charges that you are the favorite emissary of Monsieur
Burnet and that it is largely due to you the Six Nations
have latterly turned against us."
</p>

<p>
"But, Chevalier&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I will have no buts, Monsieur Ormerod.  It is beyond
reason that I should permit such a person as you to travel
undisturbed in French territory."
</p>

<p>
"But is it French territory?" I demanded.
</p>

<p>
"If the Peace of Utrecht means aught."
</p>

<p>
"I have heard it said that no two minds were alike on
that point," I commented dryly.
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"There you are right," he agreed.  "Yet it is beside
the point.  You are a trouble-maker, Monsieur.  I must
expel you.  Wherever I found you I should expel you."
</p>

<p>
"Are the French at war with the English?" I asked
hotly.
</p>

<p>
"Not that I have heard.  You are later from civilization
than I, Monsieur."
</p>

<p>
"Then why&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He brushed the objection aside.
</p>

<p>
"We deal with realities, Monsieur Ormerod.  'Tis not a
question of war but of peace&mdash;for France.  As I have said,
you are a trouble-maker.  If I let you wander free, the
next time I came this way you might have all the tribes by
the ears, united by alliances with the English Crown.  Heed
me now when I say that France came first into this country,
and France shall stay first here."
</p>

<p>
"But I say I have no interest in this country.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Black Robe bent forward sternly.
</p>

<p>
"Do not relent, my son," he said to Le Moyne.  "The
man is dangerous&mdash;his companions, too."
</p>

<p>
"You have heard my decision, father," answered the
officer.
</p>

<p>
I regarded the priest curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you dislike me?" I asked.  "We are on opposite
sides, 'tis true, but I have always fought you fair&mdash;and
once I saved your life."
</p>

<p>
This was no less than truth, for on a certain occasion,
which has nothing to do with this story, the Iroquois would
cheerfully have burned Père Hyacinthe but for my strenuous
objection.  He was in no ways grateful at the time,
I am bound to admit, and he did not exhibit gratitude now,
as he towered over the camp-fire.
</p>

<p>
"Poor worm that squirms itself into the path of
destiny!" he said harshly.  "There is no question of fair
fighting or foul fighting betwixt us, nor of gratitude or
ingratitude.  You serve Anti-Christ.  I serve the Heavenly
Father.  At no place do we touch.  We have no interests
in common.  If you did well, doubt not Holy Peter has
recorded the deed for you in his record book.  But who are
you to prate of good deeds when your soul is steeped in
the darkness of heresy, and your eyes are clouded by
English lies?  Think, rather, on your sins, and it may be
you will see light before it is too late."
</p>

<p>
He turned to Le Moyne.
</p>

<p>
"My son, I am leaving you now.  There is a village
of the Ouabaches some miles hence where I have preached
the Word.  I visit them and will rejoin you at Vincennes."
</p>

<p>
He turned on his heel and strode off.
</p>

<p>
"Hold, father," called the officer.  "Will you not rest
and eat?  An escort, surely&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The answer came from the shadows.
</p>

<p>
"I do not need an escort when I go upon my Father's
business.  I have rested all day and I have broken my
fast."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Peste!</i>" ejaculated Le Moyne.  "'Tis an uncomfortably
holy person, Monsieur Ormerod."
</p>

<p>
"Do I not know it!" I retorted.  "This is not the first
time, either."
</p>

<p>
The Frenchman chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"So I gathered.  But come, now, tell me truthfully
what is your object; 'twill do you no good to deceive.  My
hands are bound, as you must know.  This wood-ranging
is a tedious business, and I have heard naught of politics
since I left New Orleans.  What bee is buzzing in Burnet's
hat?"
</p>

<p>
I gave him a desperate look.  He was a man of good
countenance, kindly in reason, iron-willed, pugnacious,
intelligent.  So I read him.  He lounged by the fire obviously
bored.  There were no others close by save Tawannears
and Corlaer, and they were smoking and exchanging
small-talk on their own account.
</p>

<p>
"The truth?" I said.  "You shall have it&mdash;although
'tis not a story for general telling.  You, Chevalier, I can
see, are a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
He bowed courteously.
</p>

<p>
"And for that reason," I went on, "I give you my
confidence.  'Tis true, of course, that in my travels I am
keeping my eyes open for information useful to my people.
If, for instance, you sent me back to New York I should
have to tell at once of meeting this expedition and the
deductions I had drawn from it."
</p>

<p>
"Hah!" said Le Moyne.  "I don't know that I shall!
I hadn't thought of that."
</p>

<p>
"Then I should not like to be in your dilemma," I
replied.  "After all, as Père Hyacinthe told you, I am a
member of the Provincial Council.  You can't very well
incarcerate me without trial in time of peace."
</p>

<p>
"Get on with your story, Monsieur," he adjured
impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"I am hoping," I pursued, "to learn much of value.  No
Englishman that I know of hath traversed the Wilderness
Country across the Mississippi.  I would learn to what
extent our people and the French are known to its tribes,
and what is their disposition to the English, as also, the
value of the land and its geographic condition."
</p>

<p>
"My faith, Monsieur, but you are frank!" protested
the Frenchman.
</p>

<p>
"I am trying to be," I said.  "But you may believe me
or not, Chevalier.  I should not be here for that reason
alone, nor would my comrades yonder."
</p>

<p>
And I described to him as simply as possible the
combination of circumstances which had brought Tawannears,
Corlaer and myself upon this venture.  'Twas not a story
easily to be compressed, and again and again he drove me
off the main trail into byways, for bits of it had come to
him in the past&mdash;as, for instance, the matter of Gahano's
death and the grief of Tawannears&mdash;so it was very late
when I finished.  My comrades were asleep, and over the
brow of the shallow glen I could see the groups of sleepers
around the dying fires.  By the shore where the canoes
were beached and at intervals along the edge of the
encampment stood the sentinels.  Except ourselves, they
were the only souls awake.
</p>

<p>
I looked at them because my eyes were wet.  In repeating
my story I had resurrected painful memories that the
recent weeks had buried.  The old wound had reopened.
I did not like to think of the house in Pearl Street.  At that
moment I thought I never wanted to enter it again.  I
loathed the idea of returning to New York.  And I did
not want the Frenchman to see my grief.
</p>

<p>
I was brought back to the present by a crash of sparks
as he withdrew a heavy log from the fire, and the flames
flared lower.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur Ormerod," he said abruptly, "you were good
enough to call me a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
I met his eyes fully&mdash;and scarcely dared to believe what
I read there.
</p>

<p>
"I am also," he continued, "a soldier of France.  I
trust I place my country's interests above my personal
vanity, above friendship, above all.  But I should not be
a Frenchman if I did not recognize courage and the love
which spans the worlds.  I have learned a lesson from
you and your comrades to-night, Monsieur.  I thank you
for it.  You have made me a better Frenchman, a better
soldier, a better Christian."
</p>

<p>
He made a wry face at this last word.
</p>

<p>
"Although I shall have trouble convincing Père
Hyacinthe on that count," he admitted.
</p>

<p>
"You mean, Chevalier?" I queried breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"I mean, Monsieur Ormerod, that I am unable to see
how an adventure such as yours can do anything save
good.  It is an inspiration for brave men of all races.
Has it not made me a better Frenchman to hear of it?
That sleeping savage there, he is a better Frenchman than
I, even so, he, who doubtless hates my race."
</p>

<p>
He rose.
</p>

<p>
"But I am not a sufficiently better Frenchman to dare
to seem to flout Père Hyacinthe.  Oh no!  Therefore,
Monsieur Ormerod, I am going for a walk to inspect the
sentries.  I shall draw their attention to something by the
shore of the river over to the left.  In the meantime, the fire
dies.  This glen leads into the forest.  Your friends are
here.  I see you have your arms with you.  Monsieur, I
have the honor to tell you it has been a pleasure to meet
you.  <i>Adieu!</i>"
</p>

<p>
He was gone whilst I was still mumbling my thanks,
I heard his hearty voice blustering at the nearest sentries,
a running chain of comment along the outskirts of the
camp; and I was recalled to my senses.  A hand over the
mouth of each, and my comrades awoke.  Another minute,
and crouched double, we were stealing up the glen into
the welcome depths of the forest.  Five minutes later,
and our feet were spurning the leaf-mold as we ran
between the trunks, left arms outstretched before our faces
to ward off hanging boughs or vines.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE FATHER OF WATERS
</h3>

<p>
We heard no whooping of aroused savages, as must
have attended discovery of our escape; but we
dared not trust unduly in Le Moyne's generosity,
and we ran throughout the night, steering in a northwesterly
direction by the stars, in order to avoid the Ouabache
villages and the French post at Vincennes.  We came to
a halt only when the sunrise showed us to be approaching
the verge of the forest country.  Beyond the thinning tree
trunks a perspective of rolling savannahs stretched to the
horizon's rim.  Not a single tree broke the monotonous
outline, and the tall grass rippled under a gentle breeze
like the green billows of the ocean.
</p>

<p>
"We have gone far enough, brothers," said Tawannears.
"Out there a man is visible for miles.  Let us rest now
and make sure we are not followed."
</p>

<p>
We swung by a pendant grape-vine into the center of
a thorny patch of wild berry-bushes, chopped out a space
to recline in, arranged the bushes we had demolished in
the fashion of a roof so as to preserve the contour of the
patch, and abandoned ourselves to sleep.  It was noon
when we awakened again.  Indeed, Tawannears swung
himself out of our hidey-hole as I opened my eyes.  He
was gone for half an hour and returned to announce that
he had been unable to find any trace of pursuit along our
trail.
</p>

<p>
"That means we are safe," I exclaimed jubilantly.
"To-night we can steal back to the river and take a canoe
from one of the Ouabache villages."
</p>

<p>
"My brother's wits are clouded," returned Tawannears.
"Our enemies will be watching for us to do that very
thing."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," agreed Peter, yawning awake.  "Andt if we got
away they would follow us."
</p>

<p>
"True talk," said the Seneca.  "They would follow
us and they would catch us.  That way we should lose
our scalps."
</p>

<p>
"Then what can we do?" I demanded.
</p>

<p>
He pointed to the expanse of the savannahs&mdash;or prairies,
as the French call them&mdash;which we could just see over the
tree-tops.
</p>

<p>
"From here to the Father of Waters, brother, most of
the country is like that.  Corlaer and Tawannears know,
because when we made this journey before, we came all
the way by land from the Door of the Long House.  The
open country begins even farther to the east as you go
north toward the Lakes.  Over such country we can travel
almost as rapidly as in the canoe, and also, brother, we can
travel in a straight line.  The Ohio twists like a snake and
it bears away to the south, so that after it carried us to
the Great River we should have to paddle north again
against the current, for it is my purpose to make for the
country of the Dakota, above the other great river, the
Missouri, which pours into the Father of Waters on its west
side.  Corlaer and Tawannears dwelt a while with the
Dakota, before the message came summoning us to return
to the Long House, and it is my thought that they might
help us farther upon this journey, where other peoples
would seek to plunder us or take our scalps."
</p>

<p>
"You are right, as always, brother," I said.  "If Peter
agrees, let us start."
</p>

<p>
Peter heaved himself ponderously to his feet, seized his
musket and stood ready for Tawannears to lead the way.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," he squeaked placidly.  "Now we get some
buffalo-hump."
</p>

<p>
"What?" I asked, as Tawannears started down the
hillock.
</p>

<p>
"He means the wild cattle of the plains, brother,"
explained the Seneca.  "You have seen their skins in the
lodges of my people, and once, the forefathers tell us through
the Keeper of the Wampum, the buffalo ranged up to the
Doors of the Long House; but now they are seldom seen
east of the Ouabache.  Their meat is sweet and tender at
this time of the year, especially the hump of a young cow.
It will be a welcome change after jerked deerflesh."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," affirmed Corlaer, licking his lips.
</p>

<p>
And I was amused to notice the display of vigilance with
which he surveyed the country around us as we left the
protection of the forest for the open sweep of the
savannahs.  To be sure, the fat Dutchman was never as dull
as he allowed himself to seem, and he had developed the
faculties of seeing, hearing, smelling and feeling to a pitch
as acute as the savages' which is the highest praise I can
offer.  But he usually employed his ability without
ostentation.  Now, he was as palpably interested in his
surroundings as I was, and his growing disappointment, as
the afternoon waned and we had no sight of a living
creature, was comical.  Indeed, he was much put out when
I rallied him upon it, and his silence when we halted at
evening was gloomily expressive.
</p>

<p>
Our camp that night was beside a tiny rill of water that
tickled along a fold in the rolling waves of earth.  There
was no underbrush available, let alone trees, and the long
prairie grass that grew waist-high was too green to burn
readily, so we had no fire.  But we did not feel the want
of it, for the heat was terrible on the unshaded savannahs.
All day the sun had been beating down upon the earth, and
all day the earth had been drinking in the heat&mdash;to exude
it through the night like a dry sweat.
</p>

<p>
Peter and I came to envy Tawannears his nakedness,
and in the morning we stripped off our leathern shirts and
rolled them in bundles to sling from the thongs of our
food-pouches, suffering the Seneca to coat us with
bear's-grease which he carried in a horn-box, a precaution which
diminished notably the ardency of the sun's rays.  Without
its aid my unweathered shoulders must have been
broiled pink, whereas under the layer of grease they baked
gradually until in days to come they turned a warm brown
not unlike the dusky bronze hue of Tawannears himself.
</p>

<p>
We had not pushed far this morning when we came
upon a broad swath of trampled grass leading from south
to north.  Hoof-marks showed in the pulverized earth, and
Peter's little eyes glistened.
</p>

<p>
"Buffalo!" he shrilled, excited as a boy.  "Oof, now
we get some nice hump for supper."
</p>

<p>
Eyes fixed on the horizon, he set off northward at a
jog-trot, and Tawannears and I followed him, really as
anxious as he to vary the monotony of our diet.  Most of
our burnt corn and maple-sugar was gone, and we had
had scarcely anything but jerked deer-flesh for three days.
</p>

<p>
"How does he know the buffalo went north?" I
questioned.  "The trail leads in both directions."
</p>

<p>
"They always travel north at this season," rejoined
Tawannears.  "In the fall of the year they will turn
south again.  Yes, Peter is right.  This grass was trampled
only yesterday.  They must be near us."
</p>

<p>
A yelp came from the Dutchman at that moment, and
his enormous body crouched forward.
</p>

<p>
"See!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
We joined him on the summit of a slight rise.  Several
miles across the grassy sea moved a desultory procession
of brown objects, hundreds of them.
</p>

<p>
"A large herd," I commented.
</p>

<p>
Peter gave me a scornful look, and Tawannears laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Beyond the Father of Waters, brother," said the
Seneca, "you will see the buffalo in such myriads as the
wild pigeons that flew over the Ohio.  The thundering of
their hoofs will shake the ground.  They will cover the
prairie for two days' fast marching."
</p>

<p>
Peter plucked a blade of grass and tossed it in the air.
There was very little wind but what there was wafted it
over our heads.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Goodt!</i>" he grunted.  "Dey are upwindt."
</p>

<p>
"Will Corlaer stalk the buffalo without assistance?"
inquired Tawannears with his customary courtesy.
</p>

<p>
"One shot is enough," returned Peter, and he lumbered
away through the grass, his body huddled over until he
was wholly concealed.
</p>

<p>
I started to sit down to watch the Dutchman's exploit,
but Tawannears, with a light of mischief in his eyes,
prodded me off to the right, and broke into a run as soon
as we had placed one of the deceptive swells of the prairie
between us and our comrade.
</p>

<p>
"What ploy is this?" I panted.
</p>

<p>
"We will surprise Peter," he answered, laughing.  "He
thinks to stalk the buffalo, Otetiani, and instead we will
make the buffalo stalk him."
</p>

<p>
We fetched a wide semicircle northeastward, and came
up on the flank of the herd.  But before we approached
closely Tawannears halted, and we picked bunches of grass
which he arranged on our heads, so that at even a short
distance we were indistinguishable from our grassy
background.  Then we continued, working slowly around the
flank of the herd until we were in its rear.  Corlaer was
nowhere to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"Now, brother!" said Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
He cast off his head-dress, and advanced openly upon the
animals.  I imitated him, and an old bull gave a bellow of
warning.  A medley of noises answered the alarm, mooing
of cows and bleating of frightened calves and over
all the bellowing of other bulls.  The herd milled around
and gave ground before us.  Tawannears waved his arms,
and it broke into a run.
</p>

<p>
"They will go over Peter!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Tawannears.  "If it were a large herd,
perhaps.  But we have only made it easier for Peter, who
said he needed no help.  He will shoot into the herd when
it approaches him, and the buffalo will split right and left
on either side of him."
</p>

<p>
The herd topped the first swell to the south, and a shot
boomed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Watch!" said Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
The frenzied mass of huge, shaggy creatures divided
as if a giant sword had sliced down from the blazing sky
overhead.  I ran up the slope behind them and reached its
brow in time to see the halves reunite a quarter of a mile
farther on.  Directly beneath me lay the body of a fat
cow, and Peter already was at work upon it with his
knife.  Tawannears raised the war-whoop, but Peter carved
stolidly on.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," he remarked when we joined him, "you think
you put der choke on Peter, eh?  Well, you don't.  I
look back once andt I don't see you.  Andt den der herd
begins to mofe, andt it stampedes.  'Ho,' I said to
myself.  'Funny tricks!  <i>Ja</i>, funny tricks.'  But I shoot me
der best cow in der lot, yust der same.  We hafe some
nice hump for supper.  <i>Ja</i>."
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for Peter's appetite, we were able to camp
that night in a grove of dwarf trees that bordered a small
river, and the broiled buffalo hump was all that he had
anticipated.  We seized the opportunity afforded by a
plentiful supply of firewood to jerk the balance of the
choice cuts, about four stone in weight, which detained
us in the grove all of the next day.  Of course, we could
not make a thorough job of it, but it sufficed to preserve
the meat untainted in that searing heat for three or four
days longer, and at the end of that time we had worked
into a different kind of country where game was more
plentiful.
</p>

<p>
Here lush meadows alternated with dense patches of low
timber and swamps and bottomlands, these latter backwaters
of the river, which were forest-covered, yet never
completely drained.  The increasing natural difficulties
slowed our pace, and we were three days in traversing this
broken country; but Tawannears encouraged us with the
assurance that it indicated our nearness to the Great River,
which always in the Spring inundated the lands along its
course, sometimes for many miles.
</p>

<p>
This country was neither pleasant nor healthful by
contrast with the cool forests and open savannahs we had
known, and we were pestered unmercifully by a plague
of gnats.  But on the other hand we were never at a loss
for fresh meat.  We knocked over squirrels with sticks and
dragged the wild turkeys from their roosts at night.  There
was a kind of partridge, too, that plumped up under our
feet, a stupid bird easily to be slain with the tomahawk.
And one time a black bear barred our path and stood
growling at us.  We let him go, for we needed no meat and we
must husband our powder.
</p>

<p>
The third day we waded knee-deep through a flooded
forest-tract and came without warning upon the margin
of a wide, brown stream.  I hailed it for the Mississippi, at
last; but Tawannears asserted it to be the Illinois, a
tributary, which flowed down from the vicinity of the Lake of
the Michigans and entered the Mississippi opposite to and
a short distance above the Missouri.  This knowledge was
valuable, inasmuch as it told us approximately where we
were, and we turned back to nominally dry ground and
headed southwest, following the general trend of the
Illinois.  But our progress was slower than ever, for the
luxuriance of the undergrowth in those moist lowlands baffles
description.  Briars tore our skin; creepers tripped us;
bushes grew so thickly that we had to hack our way step
by step, taking turns at trail-breaking.
</p>

<p>
The next day we won to higher ground, a ridge from
which we caught occasional glimpses of the Illinois; and
in mid-afternoon we stumbled unawares upon a trail that
led from the northeast and straddled the saddle of the
ridge.
</p>

<p>
"Back!" hissed Tawannears, as we smashed carelessly
through the brushwood into the grooved slot.
</p>

<p>
Ostensibly, the trail was deserted.  A lightning glance
revealed it a vacant, green-walled tunnel.  But appearances
meant nothing in the Wilderness, and we slid behind a
fallen trunk, straining our ears for sounds of other men.
Bees buzzed over us in the soft yellow light.  We heard
water running somewhere.  Birds sang in the tree-tops.
That was all.  Minute by minute, we waited for the purr
of an arrow, the crash of a shot, the yell of the war-whoop.
But nothing happened, and at last Tawannears motioned
for us to crawl after him to a position offering ready
access to the choked lands on the river side of the ridge.
There he left us, to scout the neighborhood alone.  An hour
passed, as Peter and I knelt back to back in the underbrush,
our eyes roaming the woods on every side.  Another hour,
and I became restless.  Evening was darkening when the
hoot of an owl announced Tawannears' approach.  He
crawled into our lair, and dropped a worn moccasin in
Peter's lap.
</p>

<p>
"Chippewa," he murmured.
</p>

<p>
Peter nodded confirmation, slowly turning the footgear
in his pudgy hands.
</p>

<p>
"A war-party," continued Tawannears.  "They were
going across the Father of Waters.  Their footprints all
point toward the river."
</p>

<p>
"Der trail is fresh?" queried Corlaer.
</p>

<p>
"I found the ashes of a fire two days old," returned the
Seneca.  "It is my counsel that we lie here until morning.
I think the Chippewas are planning to cross the Great
River to hunt for Dakota scalps and buffalo robes.  The
Dakota are my brothers.  They are brave warriors, but
they have no muskets.  The Chippewas are allies of the
French.  They have muskets, and it is easier for them to
steal furs from the Dakota than to hunt the wild creatures
themselves.  Let us give them time to cross the river.
Afterward we will follow them and carry a warning to the
Dakota."
</p>

<p>
Morning brought rain, and we were afoot with the light,
avoiding the trail itself, slinking by preference through
the woods parallel with it.  It was a weary day of physical
discomfort and cautious progress, but we had our reward.
In the late afternoon we splashed out of a backwater to
emerge upon a shelving bluff, grassy and well-timbered.
From its western edge we stared at a vast yellow sea, its
farther shore dim under driving sheets of rain.
</p>

<p>
"The Father of Waters," said Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
I gasped.  Miles wide the yellow waters rolled as far
as the eye could see.  Sullen, threatening, overpowering in
its surge and breadth, the river pulsed along with a
majestic rhythm almost like a living thing.
</p>

<p>
"But how shall we cross it?" I stammered.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears waved a hand toward the saplings that
crowded the bluff.
</p>

<p>
"We have our hatchets.  We must build a raft."
</p>

<p>
We chose for our camp the site the Chippewas had
occupied, a recess under the bluff that had been dug by the
Spring freshets when the water was higher even than now,
and the débris of their raft-building told my comrades
that they had not numbered more than twenty or thirty,
an ordinary raiding party of young warriors.  It was too
late to begin work then on the raft, but in the morning,
with sunshine to hearten us, we fell to with our hatchets
and chopped down a score or two of sturdy young trees,
dragged them to a point just above water-level, and left
them there, whilst we invaded the backwaters to collect
grape-vines and other creepers, which we carried back to
the bluff by the armload.
</p>

<p>
These were Tawannears' materials, and under his direction
we formed them into a remarkably buoyant raft.  His
theory was to take a number of saplings and bind them one
to another.  On these transversely he placed a second layer,
which were first bound together and then staunchly
fastened to the bottom layer.  Two additional layers were
superimposed upon these, with the result that he had a
high-riding, practically water-tight conveyance, ample to
float the three of us.  The one difficulty we foresaw was
in forcing our way across the current, and we met this as
well as we could by whittling crude paddles and poles for
pushing in shallow water.  We were vastly proud of our
achievement when we wiped the sweat from our eyes after
two days of labor and admired the raft as it rode to a
withe cable hitched to a convenient stump.
</p>

<p>
"She floats as grandly as a frigate," I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"And no snag can sink Her," added Tawannears.  "The
Father of Waters is conscious of his might.  He is jealous
of those who would travel him.  He has knives hidden in
his bosom to wreck the unwary, but we&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hark!" interrupted Corlaer, hand upraised.
</p>

<p>
From inland came the crashing noise made by a heavy
body moving carelessly through the undergrowth, the
mutter of a voice unrestrained.  We snatched up our
rifles and ran to cover.  It was useless to think of flight on
the raft.  An enemy could riddle us as we strove to force
its unwieldy bulk out into the stream.  No, our only chance
was to stand to it, conscious that we had our backs to the
river and therefore could not be surrounded.  Perhaps
night would furnish an opportunity for us to escape by
dropping down with the current&mdash;if we were not
overwhelmed by numbers before that.  Only a strong force,
unafraid, would crash towards us in that reckless way.  It
was like white men, not Indians.  The thought sent a shiver
down my spine.  I rolled over beside Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"Is it the French, brother?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"We shall soon see," he answered grimly.  "Someone
is walking there between the trees&mdash;to your right."

CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
WE CROSS THE GREAT RIVER
</h3>

<p>
A dark object showed in the sun-flecked greenery of
the woods.  Tawannears thrust forward his musket,
and sighted along the barrel.
</p>

<p>
"He is alone," murmured Peter.
</p>

<p>
"Then there will be none to tell his story," remarked
Tawannears grimly.  "But Corlaer must not be too sure.
He may be the bait to a trap."
</p>

<p>
The strange figure strode into an opening bathed in the
warm sunlight, and I had a brief vision of a fluttering
black habit and a white blob of a face.
</p>

<p>
"It is Black Robe!" I cried softly.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears cuddled his gun to his cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Hawenneyu has delivered him into our hands," he
commented.  "If I miss, Corlaer must shoot before he can
run."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," grunted Peter.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," I exclaimed, "There must be no shooting."
</p>

<p>
"He is an enemy," answered Tawannears, unmoved.
"He hates us.  Why should my brother care whether he
lives or dies?"
</p>

<p>
"But he has done nothing to us that advantaged him," I
argued.  "He does not even know that we are here."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he does," said Tawannears.  "Perhaps he has
followed us, when Le Moyne refused to do so.  Perhaps his
Ouabaches and Miamis lurk behind him."
</p>

<p>
"He is alone," repeated Peter.  "But just der same we
better shoot him.  He is no goodt."
</p>

<p>
"It would be murder," I insisted.  "We shall serve no
object by killing him.  What harm can he do us?  In
a few hours we shall have passed the river where his
Indians cannot reach us."
</p>

<p>
The Jesuit was in full view, advancing almost directly
toward us, his eyes on the blue horizon.  He was chanting
to himself in a deep, sonorous voice, and as he drew nearer
I identified the words of the Vesper Hymn:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "mens gravata crimine,<br>
  Vitae sit exul munere,<br>
  Dum nil perenne cogitat,<br>
  Seseque culpis illigat."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I am going to speak to him," I said.  "It can do no
harm.  He does not know we are here.  Why, Tawannears,
the man is fearless.  He would walk straight into your
musket, and defy you to shoot.  Moreover, he has withstood
the torture more than once, and I do not think he is right
in his head.  Would you be proud of killing one whose
mind the Great Spirit had wrapped in a cloud?"
</p>

<p>
Tawannears was all Indian, despite his perfect English
and the erudition he had absorbed from his missionary
teachers.  Corlaer, after a life among the red men, had
imbibed many of their prejudices.  My last remark turned
the scale.  A man whose mentality had been touched was
sacred to any tribe.
</p>

<p>
The Seneca smiled unwillingly.
</p>

<p>
"Otetiani is a strong pleader.  Very well.  Let Black
Robe live.  But if he meditates treachery we must kill
him, even though Hawenneyu has set him aside among
men."
</p>

<p>
"He is alone," declared Peter for the third time.  "Always
he trafels alone.  I know it.  But he is no friend to
us.  We watch him, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely," I agreed.  "He is a Frenchman and our
enemy.  That I do not deny.  But he cannot harm us.
Come, we will ask him his business here.  Afterwards, if
necessary, we will keep watch on him."
</p>

<p>
Black Robe had halted some thirty yards south of our
hiding place, and stood now on the edge of the bluff,
surveying the wonderful prospect of the unbridled river, its
yellow waters glistening in the sunlight, the opposite bank
a low green wall two miles or more away.  His lips moved
in words I could not hear, and he dropped to his knees in
the attitude of prayer, head bowed, and remained so many
minutes, his body rigid with the ecstasy of devotion.
</p>

<p>
I waited until he had risen again, then stepped from
our hiding-place and walked toward him.  Tawannears and
Corlaer followed me.  He saw us almost at once, but he
made no sign of surprise.  He simply stood, facing us, his
terribly maimed hands locked in front of him, his spare
frame vibrant with the suppressed energy of the indomitable
spirit within him.
</p>

<p>
"So you came this way," he said harshly.  "I thought
as much, but they would not listen to me."
</p>

<p>
"And you, Père Hyacinthe?" I asked.  "Where do you go?"
</p>

<p>
"I go upon my Father's business," he answered in the
phrase I had heard him use more than once before.
</p>

<p>
"Alone?"
</p>

<p>
His pallid, riven face cracked in what I suppose he
intended for a smile of sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I take with me such guards as attend the Holy
Father when he rides in state?  No, but I am guarded,
Englishman.  Cohorts of angels attend me.  The cherubim
chant me on my way.  It suffices."
</p>

<p>
"I do not seek to probe your affairs," I replied as
politely as I could, "but you are our enemy.  We do not
wish to harm you, yet we must protect ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"You cannot harm me," he said without irritation.
"Enemy?  No, my erring son, I am not your enemy&mdash;or,
rather say I am enemy only to the evil that hath possession
of you.  But content yourself.  I have come many miles this
day and I saw no living thing, save the beasts of the
forest."
</p>

<p>
I was satisfied, for I knew it was not in the priest to lie.
</p>

<p>
"Have you food?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Food?" he repeated doubtfully, almost as if he had
not understood me.  "No, but I shall eat."
</p>

<p>
"If a heretic's food&mdash;&mdash;" I began.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven's grace is vouchsafed in divers ways," he cut
me off curtly.  "It may be this opportunity has been given
you to find an escape from sin.  I will eat your food,
Englishman."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears and Peter listened sullenly to my invitation,
and their faces expressed neither welcome nor toleration
as the Jesuit walked back with us to the recess under the
bluff.
</p>

<p>
His hollow eyes lighted with unusual interest when he
spied our raft.
</p>

<p>
"You are crossing the Great River, Monsieur Ormerod?"
</p>

<p>
He seemed tricked out of his dour mannerisms for the
moment.  His voice took on the casual courtesy of one
gentleman to another.  But it was a fleeting manifestation,
no doubt an echo from some long-buried past.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "as I told the Chevalier&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Strange," he interrupted me abruptly, his old manner
returning, "that you of all men should be appointed to
aid in the fulfilling of my mission.  How inscrutable are
God's ways!  Yet there must be a meaning in this.  Blessed
Virgin aid me!"
</p>

<p>
My comrades would have nothing to do with him.  They
took their food and removed out of ear-shot, leaving me to
do the honors, which was only fair, inasmuch as I had
foisted him upon them.  But it insured an ill evening for
me, for Black Robe utilized the opportunity to examine me
at length upon my religious convictions&mdash;sketchy, at best,
I fear, after a lifetime of wandering&mdash;and read me a
lecture upon the errors of my creed.  I marvel much as I
look back upon that incident.  In many ways I hold he
was wrong, but of all men I have known as well I must
account him the most holy.  He knew not the meaning of
the word self-interest.  Life for him was service of the
Word of God, as he understood it.  He wasted no time in
the search of Truth, for he held that it was ready to hand,
ay, inscribed in letters of fire across the skies for all men
to see.
</p>

<p>
He talked to me for hours after the others slept, and
I listened with undiminished interest to the end.  The
man's stern conviction was an inspiration, whether you
agreed with him or not.  And if some hold me religiously a
weakling because I grant him the merit of believing what
he preached, my answer is that such as he was, he&mdash;and
many others like him&mdash;was one of the most potent forces
in carrying the rule of the white man into the Wilderness
Country.  If he and his fellows did not convert the savages,
at least they taught them the strength of the white man's
will, and by their pioneering endeavor they taught their
own people the worth of the unknown lands that always
lie beyond the horizon's rim.
</p>

<p>
In the night the weather shifted, and the morning was
overcast and blustery, with a changeable wind.  We
debated whether we should trust ourselves to the raft under
such conditions, and Tawannears and Peter advised against
it until Black Robe derided their fears.
</p>

<p>
"What?" he cried in the Seneca dialect, which came
readily to him, he having been long a missionary to the
People of the Long House.  "Is the Warden of the Western
Door afraid to go upon the waters?  Is Corlaer, whose
fat belly is dreaded by every squaw from Jagara to the
mouth of the Mohawk, fearful lest he wet his moccasins?
You have dared all manner of perils over hundreds of
leagues, and now you wince at a few leagues of water!
Pluck up your courage!  I am the wreck of what was
a man, yet I am not afraid.  Will you let me daunt you?"
</p>

<p>
"Black Robe does not know what he says," replied
Tawannears stiffly.  "A silly little bird has whistled idle
thoughts in his ear.  He knows well that Tawannears does
not fear even the Master of Evil, Hanegoategeh, whom
Black Robe serves."
</p>

<p>
Peter said nothing, after his fashion, but his little eyes
squinted thoughtfully, and presently he drew us aside.
</p>

<p>
"If Black Robe is touched in der head we might be
safe," he proposed.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," I retorted impatiently, "what has that to
do with whether the wind blows or the waters rise?  It is
dangerous out there on the raft or it is not.  Black Robe
has nothing to do with it."
</p>

<p>
"My brother Otetiani may be right," said Tawannears,
"yet he has said that the Great Spirit has taken Black
Robe under his protection.  If that is true, will
Hawenneyu allow him to drown?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not," I admitted, "but we might drown
whilst he escaped."
</p>

<p>
"Otetiani speaks with a straight tongue," affirmed the
Seneca.  "Nevertheless I say that we cannot let Black
Robe put a slight upon us.  There is danger on the bosom
of the Father of Waters.  But if we do not venture forth
Black Robe will laugh at us, and perhaps some day he will
tell the story to his people.  Let us go."
</p>

<p>
I shrugged my shoulders.  I did not like the look of the
river.  It was roughening every minute.  But neither could
I resist the quaint logic of Tawannears, and of course, no
man enjoys being told he is afraid.
</p>

<p>
"Have it your own way," I said at last.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears walked up to the priest.
</p>

<p>
"We go," he said quietly.  "If we die, remember that
you urged us forth."
</p>

<p>
One of those rare reflections of a personality long
submerged shone in the Jesuit's face.  He dropped his hand
upon the Seneca's bare shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"There is naught to fear," he said gently.  "God watches
over us on the water as on the land.  If He has ordained
for you to die, you will die.  The good warrior thinks not
upon death, but upon his mission."
</p>

<p>
His manner changed.  His hand dropped by his side.
His voice became harsh.
</p>

<p>
"Heathen, would you blame me for your wickedness?
As well do so as charge me with your death!  You and I
have no power over life!  Look up!  Look up, I say!  There
is the Power that decides all.  Ha, you fear&mdash;you fear what
you know not!"
</p>

<p>
His face a study in masked fury, Tawannears strode to
the side of the raft, drew his knife and laid the keen edge
against the mooring withe.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears waits," he said.
</p>

<p>
Black Robe stepped aboard without a word.  Peter and
I climbed after him, and the Seneca severed the withe
with a single slash.  We piled our muskets, powder-horns
and pouches upon a raised framework in the center of the
unwieldy craft, where they would be out of the reach of
the water, and took to the pushing poles, the Jesuit lending
a hand, and shoved out into the current.
</p>

<p>
The raft rode high, as we had expected, but its heavy
weight made it drag fearfully in the slack water under the
bank.  We bent all our strength on the poles, yet the headway
we achieved was trifling.  Sagging, lurching, its component
trees rustling and squelching, it crawled forward a foot or
two at a time.  A sandbar held us up for an hour, and
after an unsuccessful effort to push across, we finally
contrived to float around it.  Then we resumed the battle, and
half-naked as we were, the sweat poured from us and our
muscles ached.  How Black Robe endured it I do not know.
Of us all he alone did not sweat, but he worked unflinchingly
until the moment, when, without warning, a monstrous
force seemed to seize upon the raft.
</p>

<p>
There was a swirl, a peculiar sucking noise&mdash;and the
shore began to recede.  The raft wavered crazily, twirled
about, started across the current and as abruptly was
spun back downstream.  We stood stupidly, leaning on our
poles, scarcely realizing what had happened.
</p>

<p>
"The river does our work for us, it seems," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears shook his head, a worried expression in his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"No, brother, the worst is ahead of us.  The river is
like a wild beast to-day."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," squeaked Corlaer, striking his pole down in a
futile effort to find bottom.
</p>

<p>
Black Robe remained by himself on the forepart of the
raft, his gaze on the mirky distance where he appeared to
be able to see landscapes that were denied to our
earth-bound spirits.
</p>

<p>
"We can work across the current," I suggested.  "It
may take time, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A yellow-brown wave, its crest tipped with scum, slapped
against the side of the raft and spattered our feet.
Another rolled in from the opposite quarter and lapped over
the side.  The structure of the raft groaned and shifted.
</p>

<p>
"It will take many hours," answered Tawannears.  "Our
work has just begun."
</p>

<p>
We got out the rough paddles we had carved and undertook
to steer diagonally with the current, but experience
proved that a consistent course was impossible of
attainment.  We made distance in the desired direction&mdash;and
were promptly picked up by an eddy and tossed back
again, or else the vagrant wind set in to toy with us.  The
waves rolled higher constantly, and we were wet to the
waist.  But we fought on, and the longer we fought the
more intelligent our efforts became.
</p>

<p>
There was a trick to this work, a trick entirely different
from navigating a light, amenable, birchen canoe.  Our
raft had a will of its own, and a certain sense of decency.
Handled as it desired to be, it would even accomplish a
measure of our desires, and gradually we came to learn
its ways.  This aided us in winning ground&mdash;or, I should
say, water; but nothing could aid us in conflicting the
capricious moods of wind and current.  Sometimes we had
both behind us, and then we were driven rapidly
downstream.  Again, the wind would come from the quarter and
mitigate somewhat the effect of the current.  Mid-afternoon
found us with nothing gained beyond a hazardous mid-stream
course that was varied by occasional wild lurches in
the direction of one shore or the other.
</p>

<p>
When the current discharged us towards the eastern
bank we battled desperately against it.  When, in one of
its incomprehensible moments of beneficence, it started us
in the desired direction we labored with gritting teeth to
assist it.  And every time this happened it ended by
spinning us around and starting us back the way we had come.
Night shut down upon us miles from our starting place,
but less than half-way across.
</p>

<p>
Sleep, of course, was unthinkable.  We were wet.  We
had little edible food.  But tired as we were, we were still
unwilling to suspend for a minute our struggle against the
river.  Moreover, we now required all our vigilance, for
the waters were laden with other floating objects, sinister,
half-sunken projectiles that had been trees and were now
the instruments of the river's wrath.  One of these, a giant
hulk of wood, careened against us in the faint star-light and
partially demolished the structure upon which we had
placed our arms and superfluous clothing.  We narrowly
escaped losing all our store of powder in this misadventure,
and the shock had noticeable effect in loosening the fabric
of the raft.  It developed an increasing sluggishness, a
more frequent tendency to lurch uncertainly, and our
attempts to direct its progress became ridiculously inept.
</p>

<p>
But we did not desist.  The night was cool, but we
sweated as we had on the broiling savannahs, and tapped
unknown reservoirs of strength to maintain our fight.  We
seldom spoke to one another.  There was little occasion for
words, except once in a while to shout a warning.  And
Black Robe paddled and poled beside us, hour by hour.
I do not remember that he ever spoke that night.  We were
afraid, frankly, openly afraid, admitting it tacitly one to
another.  But I am sure that he was as serenely indifferent
to fate as he had been in prodding us to start.  He was the
only one who did not croak hoarse exultation when the
river played its last trick upon us.
</p>

<p>
This came just after sunrise.  We had felt for the past
hour an erratic swirl in the eddying current.  Now we
sighted a mile or so ahead of us to the right the mouth of
another river, little narrower than the Mississippi.
</p>

<p>
"That is the Missouri, brothers!" exclaimed Tawannears.
"We are far downstream.  If we are carried beyond
this we shall land in the country of the Mandans,
who are enemies of the Dakota and eaters of human flesh.
Hawenneyu has veiled his face from us!"
</p>

<p>
But at that instant Hawenneyu withdrew the veil and
smiled upon us.  What happened, I think, was that the
incoming stream of the Missouri, meeting the torrent of
the Mississippi, combined with the Great River to form a
whirlpool of eddies, with a backshoot toward the western
bank.  At any rate, we were suddenly spun about like a
chip in a kennel, so rapidly that it was dizzying.  Nothing
that we could do had any influence upon the course of the
raft.  We tried to work against the eddies for several
moments, and finally gave it up in disgust, determined to
meet whatever doom was in store for us without flinching.
</p>

<p>
Our reward was to be impelled at most amazing speed
toward the west bank.  Twice on our way we were caught
and torn at by opposing eddies, but each time the raft
worked free of its own volition, and the rising sun saw us
floating, water-logged and bedraggled, in a backwater under
the western bank, perhaps half a mile above the mouth
of the Missouri.
</p>

<p>
We were still a long way from shore, of course, and it
required two hours of steady poling to work us through the
sandbars to within wading distance of the river's edge;
but we made it.  We shouldered our muskets and staggered
ashore to collapse upon the bank just above the
water-level&mdash;all except Black Robe.  Without a glance at us or
the sodden remnants of the raft that had carried him here,
without even a casual inspection of the country before him,
he climbed the bank and strode westward.  He had not slept
through the night; he had eaten a bare handful of food
since morning; he had labored as hard as we had.
</p>

<p>
I called after him, but he dismissed me with an
impatient wave of the hand.  The last I saw of him his
black figure was outlined sparsely against a low wood.
There was an uncompromising air to his back I did not
like, but I could not have pursued him to save myself.
Tawannears and Peter were stretched inert upon the bank
beside me, their eyes closed in sleep.  I hesitated&mdash;and sank
beside them.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
THE COUNTRY OP THE DAKOTA
</h3>

<p>
"Wake, brother, wake!"
</p>

<p>
The words rang faintly in my ears.  Mingled
with them was a peculiar underlying sound.
"Pop!  Pop!  Pop!" it went, and rippled off into the
noise a wood fire makes when it is burning merrily.
</p>

<p>
I was conscious of being shaken, resented it, tried to pull
away&mdash;and reluctantly awoke.  Tawannears was bending
over me, clutching my shoulder.  His face showed relief as
I sat erect.
</p>

<p>
"Otetiani slept as though he were already in the Halls
of the Honochenokeh," he said.  "Hark!"
</p>

<p>
Stupefied as I was, I realized that the peculiar sound
which had helped to rouse me from the slumber of
exhaustion was the steady crackle of musketry.
</p>

<p>
"Black Robe!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"It may be so, but the firing is not at us, brother.
Come, let us join Corlaer."
</p>

<p>
I stood up, musket in hand, and for the first time was
aware of the soreness of muscle, joint and sinew.  Every
inch of my body seemed to cherish its special ache or
twinge.
</p>

<p>
"We are in no condition for fighting," I remarked
glumly.
</p>

<p>
"The warrior fights when he must," returned Tawannears
sententiously.  "Hasten, brother.  Corlaer waits us."
</p>

<p>
I climbed after him toward the top of the bank where
I could barely see the Dutchman's big form huddled in the
grass that grew as high as our waists.  The sun was
declining in the western sky.  The wind was negligible.  The
Mississippi, behind us, was as calm as a ditch-pond, and in
the clear, warm sunlight the opposite shore looked absurdly
near.  It was difficult to believe that our battle to cross
it had ended only that morning.
</p>

<p>
From the crest of the bank an entirely different prospect
appeared.  Crawling into the grass beside Peter, Tawannears
and I peered cautiously over its rustling tips to the
wall of the low wood in which Black Kobe had vanished.
This wood was half a mile distant.  Between it and the
river-bank stretched an open meadow.  Another half-mile
to our left a few scattered clumps of bushes denoted the
bank of the Missouri.  We were ensconced upon one side of
a triangle of land at the intersection of the two rivers, and
it was obvious that the fighting going on under cover of
the wood was working down into this open triangle.
Apparently one body of men were seeking to drive a second
body into the <i>cul de sac</i> of the triangle.
</p>

<p>
Even as my mind formulated this theory there was a
flash of color on the edge of the wood and a figure darted
into the open.  It was an Indian, a tall man, wearing a
headdress of feathers such as I had never seen before, a
bonnet that encircled the head and reached down between
his shoulders, giving him an exaggerated effect of height.
He leaped back behind a tree as we watched, fitted an
arrow to his bow and loosed it into the recesses of the wood.
Then he turned and ran.  He had not covered a dozen
yards when a shot was fired, and he bounded high in
air and fell upon his face.
</p>

<p>
Other men, similarly dressed, leaped into view, pausing
momentarily to take advantage of the last cover of the
wood to loose their arrows against whoever was pursuing
them.  There must have been a score of them, I suppose,
all fine, tall warriors, naked but for breechclout, moccasins
and headdress; and they ran like antelope across our range
of vision.  From the wood came occasional reports and
a second man plunged to the ground.  We heard a shrill
yelping.
</p>

<p>
"Dakota," granted Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"What does it mean?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
He pushed his musket into position.
</p>

<p>
"Be patient, brother.  Let us see what happens next."
</p>

<p>
Other figures broke from the wood, whooping and firing
after the fleeing Dakota, who, their bows hopelessly
out-ranged, made no attempt at resistance, but raced for the
protection of the Missouri bank.
</p>

<p>
"Chippewa!" squeaked Corlaer.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears nodded, frowning.
</p>

<p>
"They are the war-party who crossed the Great River
ahead of us," he agreed.  "What shall we do, brothers?
The Chippewa are allies of the French.  Corlaer and
Tawannears have spent many months in the teepees of the
Dakotas.  But the odds are heavy against our Dakota
brothers.  If we cast our lot with them we may lose our
own scalps."
</p>

<p>
"We are in sore danger, no matter which way we turn,"
I retorted.  "The Chippewa would show us no mercy at
any time.  I am for aiding the Dakota.  If we can save
them they will be all the more eager to help us on our
venture, as you suggested before."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," assented Corlaer.  "Andt we gife dose Chippewa
a surprise, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"We must give them Death," answered Tawannears
grimly.
</p>

<p>
He made good his words as he spoke; and I brought down
a second man.  Corlaer waited until I had almost finished
reloading, and secured two men in a row for target, hitting
one in the shoulder and drilling the other through the
body.  Firing at ease, with our guns in rest, we could not
miss; and the Chippewa, with howls of rage, promptly went
to cover in the long grass.
</p>

<p>
This marked the initiation of a second phase of the
engagement.  The Chippewa were excellent marksmen, and
when Corlaer took his second shot they deluged him with
bullets that dug up the sods around him and sent him
rolling down the bank, spitting dirt out of his mouth.
Tawannears and I slid after him, deeming discretion preferable
to valor.
</p>

<p>
If our fusillade had astonished the Chippewa it had been
equally disconcerting to the Dakota.  They did not know
what to make of it.  At first they seemed to fear a
trap, but when they marked the furious discharge of
their enemies that drove us over the bank they evidently
decided we must be friends, and struck off from their line
of flight at right angles so as to accommodate a union of
forces with us.
</p>

<p>
We, on our part, were concerned to effect this union and
at the same time compel the Chippewa to hold off long
enough to permit us an opportunity to concert a plan of
strategy with the Dakota band.  So after trotting a rod
down-river we reclimbed the bank and poured a second
volley into the line of Chippewa, whose crouching figures
were only half-concealed by the waving grass-tips.  Before
they could shift their aim from the position we had
formerly occupied we had slid down the bank and were making
for a new vantage-point.
</p>

<p>
By means of such tactics we were able to force the
Chippewa to an advance as slow as it was cautious, for
they dared not expose themselves unduly after the punishment
we had inflicted in the beginning, and we secured time
to work down river to where the remnants of the Dakota
band hugged the protection of the bank, arrows notched,
and curious glances mirroring the suspicion they still
entertained of such unexpected rescuers.  But their suspicion
faded as we came close enough for them to identify Tawannears
and the immense body of the Dutchman.
</p>

<p>
Their chief, a sinewy giant of forty, with a high-beaked
nose and keen, direct gaze, his headdress of golden eagle's
feathers, stepped forward to greet us, a light of welcome
on his face; and both my friends exclaimed at sight of him.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know him?" I panted eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"He is Chatanskah*, Chief of the Wahpeton Council
Fire," answered Tawannears briefly.  "Many a buffalo
he has stalked with Corlaer and Tawannears."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* White Hawk.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Chatanskah exchanged a few curt sentences with Tawannears,
who nodded agreement with what he said, and then
led his warriors at a dead run toward the junction of
the two rivers&mdash;the apex of the triangle over which this
fighting ranged.  The Seneca motioned for us to follow
them.
</p>

<p>
"Haste, brothers!" he urged.  "We must trick the
Chippewa.  It is Chatanskah's plan to seek the protection
of the wood where it approaches the Missouri bank, nearly
opposite here."
</p>

<p>
But this was not so easy of accomplishment as it sounded.
The Chippewa soon appreciated our intent, and we had not
doubled the apex of the blunt promontory, with its glacis
of mudflats, when they tumbled over the Mississippi bluff
and pelted us with lead.  Others headed across the meadow
which constituted the heart of the triangle, thinking to cut
us off as we bounded its outer edge, but Tawannears,
Corlaer and I crawled to the top of the Missouri bluff and
drove them to cover again.  And at last, by dint of this
and similar desperate ploys, we were enabled to scramble
up the Missouri bank in the rear of our allies and dash
across a narrow belt of grass land into the green shelter
of the wood, a shower of balls slicing the boughs about our
shoulders.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There we were reasonably safe, and Tawannears explained
the situation to us whilst the Dakota produced meat
from their pouches, and we snatched a hasty meal as the
evening shadows lengthened.
</p>

<p>
"This wood runs west and north for a mile," he said.
"Beyond it the country is all open, buffalo grazing-ground
where the Dakota were hunting when the Chippewa
surprised them this afternoon.  It is Chatanskah's counsel
that we hold the wood until it is dark when he can afford to
risk taking to the prairie.  The Dakota villages are a long
day's&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was interrupted by the resumption of the Chippewa's
attack.  They had massed their men behind the Missouri
bank in front of us, and fired into the wood as rapidly as
they could load and reload.  Bullets "<i>phutted!</i>" into the
trees, swished through the branches and whistled in the air.
I was long to remember the sinister song they sang, for
years were to pass before I was again obliged to stand up
to the battering of musketry.  The racket was awesome, yet
it achieved remarkably little harm.  One of the Dakota
abandoned shelter to loose an arrow and sagged to the
ground with a bullet in his lungs.  Otherwise we were
scathless so far.
</p>

<p>
The firing increased in volume.  It became a hell of fury,
and we could hear the Chippewa yelling encouragement to
one another.  Smoke clouds billowed out from the bank in
thick, cottony puffs, and suddenly Chatanskah screeched a
warning.  The smoke clouds seemed to vomit forth
low-running figures, musket in one hand, tomahawk in the
other.  But this was a chance for which Tawannears, Peter
and I had been waiting, and we made our shots count.  Our
allies, too, were not dismayed.  In the smoky dusk, at such
short distances, the bow was on more than equal terms with
the musket.
</p>

<p>
The Chippewa did not dare to stop to reload.  They were
obliged to rely upon the covering fire of the half-dozen
comrades who had remained behind the bank, and these
found it impossible to aim because of the heavy smoke that
the dying wind could not disperse.  The Dakota bows
boomed with savage joy.  All around us I heard the tense,
twanging hum of the strings, the prolonged "<i>his-ss-s-tsst!</i>"
of the arrows.  Out in the open men tossed their arms aloft
and dropped with arrows in their bowels, or fell kicking
and coughing, pierced in the throat, or went straight over
backward with a bunch of feathers standing up just over
their hearts.
</p>

<p>
The attack faltered and gave ground, and the Dakota
warriors burst from the wood.  Two of them collapsed
before a ragged volley from the river-bank, but there was
no stopping them.  They swept over the field with
tomahawk and scalping-knife, and their arrows drove the
surviving Chippewa out upon the mudflats, where they
would have followed if Chatanskah had not called them in,
fearful of an ambuscade in the gathering darkness.
</p>

<p>
That was a proud night for the Dakota band.  The youngest
warrior counted coup, for the Chippewa had lost two-thirds
of their number.  But what pleased our new friends
the most was not their tale of scalps, but the eighteen
French firelocks that were theirs for lifting from the
ground.  It was the biggest haul of war-booty their tribe
had ever taken, of incalculable military value, as the future
was soon to show.  Moreover, that battle in the triangle
between the two rivers, obscure though it was, became
famous in the annals of the plains tribes, as proving that
under favorable circumstances they could stand up to the
forest tribes from the east side of the Mississippi, despite
the better arms of the forest warriors.  And many chiefs,
who up to that time had concentrated their efforts upon
stealing horses, branched out into elaborate schemes for
procuring musketry.
</p>

<p>
Weary as his men were&mdash;and we no less than they&mdash;Chatanskah
would not allowed them to camp on the scene
of their victory.  Loaded with the spoil, which was
considerable, including, besides the muskets, their enemies'
equipment of powder-horns and shot-pouches, knives,
tomahawks and other weapons, the band trotted through the
wood and out upon the open prairie beyond.  With the
rising moon to light them they headed inland from the
Missouri, bearing northwest by the stars, and doggedly
maintained the pace until I guessed it to be midnight.  Then
Chatanskah consented to make camp, without fires, and set
guards for the balance of the night.  Tawannears offered to
have us take our share of this duty, but the Dakota chief
would not hear of it.
</p>

<p>
"What?" he exclaimed.  "Shall a guest be asked to wait
upon himself?  Chatanskah and his warriors were as good
as dead men when Tawannears and his white brothers came
to their rescue.  We owe you our lives.  And now you shall
sit in the center of my teepee.  My squaws shall wait upon
you.  My young men shall hunt you game.  Our old men
shall tell you stories of the long-ago.  If you will stay with
us we will find you maidens to suit your eyes and we will
make strong medicine to turn the white brothers red, and
you shall become chiefs of the Dakota.  Then the tribe will
prosper and grow mighty in war."
</p>

<p>
His eyes gleamed as he conjured up that picture of
prowess.
</p>

<p>
"That is a plan worth considering, my brother of the
Hodenosaunee," he went on.  "We will raid the Chippewa,
the Miami, the Potawotomi, the Illinois, the Shawnee for
guns.  We will steal horses from the Spaniards and the
tribes below the Missouri.  We will grow great, brother."
</p>

<p>
"My brother forgets," Tawannears answered gently.
"When I was among the Dakota before I told of a search
I had undertaken."
</p>

<p>
"True," the Dakota assented, crestfallen.  "And does
Tawannears still pursue that search?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, brother.  My white brothers go with me.  We
seek the Land of Lost Souls, which the old tales of my
people say is beyond the sunset."
</p>

<p>
The Dakota shrugged his powerful shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"It may be.  My people know nothing of it."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears hesitated, and I who knew him so well, recognized
that he dreaded to press the question.  But his will
triumphed over his spiritual fear.
</p>

<p>
"Has Chatanskah asked any warriors from afar if they
know of the Land of Lost Souls?"
</p>

<p>
"Chatanskah never forgets a promise to a friend,"
returned the Dakota.  "Many times I have spoken with the
brothers of the Dakota Council-fires that stretch toward
the Sky Mountains.  What is beyond those mountains they
do not know.  This land you speak of may be there.  But
they do not know.  No warrior has ever gone far across the
mountains and returned.  A large band dies of hunger
and thirst.  A few warriors are killed by the people of the
rocky places."
</p>

<p>
"Yet Tawannears and his white brothers will go there,"
the Seneca declared.
</p>

<p>
"If you go, you will die," replied Chatanskah.  "It will
be much better to stay with Chatanskah and become a
great chief."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless Tawannears must go on," insisted Tawannears.
"My brother of the Dakota has said that he owes
us his life.  Will he pay the debt he owes by aiding us on
our way?"
</p>

<p>
The Dakota bowed his head.
</p>

<p>
"Chatanskah may not deny what Tawannears and his
white brothers ask.  You shall come with us to our villages,
and rest awhile.  Our squaws will repair your moccasins.
You shall grow fat and strong, for it is easy to see that
you have traveled hard and gone hungry.  Afterward, if
you still ask it, Chatanskah and his young men will take
you west to our brothers of the Teton Council Fire, and
they shall guide you to the foot of the Sky Mountains.
</p>

<p>
"And now let Tawannears sleep in peace.  Chatanskah
will watch."
</p>

<p>
But hours later I was aroused by a cold wind that blew
from the north, and I sat up to find Tawannears sitting
with his chin on his knees, his arms wrapped around his
ankles, his eyes on the star-flecked western sky.  On his face
was that terrible expression of exaltation which I had seen
there many times before, a look of brooding anticipation,
of fearful expectancy, as of one who hopes to see, but dreads
the test.
</p>

<p>
It was an eery moment betwixt the night and the dawn.
The wind clashed overhead and the stars seemed to stoop
earthward.  There was a feeling of unheard voices chanting
behind the sky.  I remembered the agony I had known,
that I was now fleeing from.  And without cause or reason
I felt my heart leap in my breast, and the wells of sorrow
seemed to empty and dry up.  But a voice whispered out
of nowhere:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Alone!  Alone!  Alone!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Yet I was not dismayed.  I was alone, yes.  But memories
flocked forward to draw the sting from the word.
</p>

<p>
Memory!  That was the key to it, I saw.  Out of memory
a man might whittle a new life, a club to shatter loneliness.
</p>

<p>
I probed the dark corners of my mind to test the theory,
dragged forward thoughts and recollections which once
must have set all my nerves ajangling.  And now they fell
into orderly sequence, suffered themselves to be arrayed and
rearrayed, tabulated and put back whence they had come.
From some of them I had pleasure.  From some a stab of
pain.  But I was always their master.  My grief was cured.
My mind was again my own.
</p>

<p>
I spoke softly to Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"My brother has not slept?"
</p>

<p>
He turned sad eyes upon me.
</p>

<p>
"No, Tawannears thinks of the past&mdash;and the hopelessness
of the future.  But what is this?"  He bent toward
me.  "Otetiani's eyes are clear.  The Evil Spirit no longer
clouds his face."
</p>

<p>
"I have found peace, brother," I said simply.
</p>

<p>
A sudden flame of inner light burned the dejection from
his face.
</p>

<p>
"Otetiani has saved Tawannears from himself.  Hawenneyu
has spoken.  Hanegoategoh has lost his grip.  The
future is hope, brother."
</p>

<p>
He lay down where he was and was instantly asleep.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
THE FIGHT FOR THE HERD
</h3>

<p>
Chatanskah's village was a group of buffalo-hide
teepees on the bank of a creek flowing into the
Missouri, constituting with several similar communities
the Wahpeton Council Fire.  This was one of the seven
divisions, or sub-tribes, of the Dakota, who held the north
bank of the Missouri as far as the foothills of the Sky
Mountains, and whose political organization, in some ways,
reminded me of the great Iroquois Confederacy, an opinion
which Tawannears also entertained.
</p>

<p>
There was about these sons of the open savannahs the
same sturdy self-reliance and classic dignity which marked
the People of the Long House, dwelling beneath the shadow
of the primeval forest which covered most of the Wilderness
country east of the Mississippi.  They were all big men,
lithely-muscled, handsome, with clean-cut, intelligent
features, fearless warriors, clever hunters, splendid orators.
Like the Iroquois, too, they had conceived the advantages
of union, and were consequently feared by all the
neighboring tribes.
</p>

<p>
We had dwelt with them upwards of a week, resting from
the fatigue of our recent adventures, when a party of young
men came in with news of the approach of a gigantic herd
of buffalo from the north.  The end of Summer was at
hand, and the herds ranging north were beginning to turn
back for the southward migration to the Spanish countries,
an event of the utmost importance for the Dakota, for whom
the buffalo furnished the staples of existence.
</p>

<p>
They fed largely upon its flesh.  They clad themselves
in its fur.  They wove rope from its hair.  Its dung they
used for fuel in a country nearly destitute of wood.  From
its sinews they devised bow-strings.  Its horns were
employed for weapons or to strengthen their bows or for
containers.
</p>

<p>
For them the buffalo represented the difference between
hunger and repletion, between cold and warmth, between
nakedness and protection&mdash;as it did for all the surrounding
tribes, for hundreds of thousands of wild, free-roving
people, inhabiting a country equal to the area of western
Europe.  And the buffalo was most valuable in the late
Summer or Fall, after it had fattened for months upon the
juicy grasses of the boundless savannahs, and its fur was
grown long and silky in preparation for the Winter.
</p>

<p>
There was a flurry of preparation amongst the teepees,
and as every man counted, we volunteered to accompany the
hunting party, which Chatanskah mustered within the
hour.  The second day we came upon isolated bunches of
buffalo, but the chief would not permit his warriors to
attack them, claiming, with reason, that if the animals
continued in their present direction they would pass close by
the village, and might be attended to by the home-stayers.
The third day we saw several large herds of many thousands
each, but the young men who had brought the news of the
migration claimed that the main herd was yet ahead of us.
</p>

<p>
We proved this true the next morning when the prairies
showed black under the migratory hordes.  North and west
they filled the landscape.  Eastward they stretched for a
bare half-mile, and Chatanskah hastened to lead his hunters
across the front of the serried columns, so as to be able to
attack the herd in flank and maintain a constant forward
pressure.  No man would have cared to attempt to stop in
front of that animal mass.  Their hoofs shook the ground,
and a slight haze of dust rose over them.
</p>

<p>
To gain our flanking position we were compelled to dip
into the bed of a small creek shaded by dwarf trees, and
we followed this for perhaps a quarter of a mile.  Coming
out into the open again, an entirely different spectacle
presented itself.  Bearing down upon the herd from the
northeast appeared a second party of warriors fully as
numerous as our own.  Exclamations broke from the Dakota
ranks, and although at that distance the strangers looked
to me no different from our allies, none of Chatanskah's
men were in doubt as to their identity, and Tawannears
answered my question without hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"Cheyenne, brother.  They are the Striped-arrow People,
so-called from their custom of using turkey feathers on
their arrow-shafts."
</p>

<p>
"Are they friends or enemies?"
</p>

<p>
He smiled.
</p>

<p>
"When two tribes have one herd of buffalo, Otetiani,
they cannot be anything else but enemies."
</p>

<p>
"Yet surely there are buffalo enough here for all the
Indians in the Wilderness!"
</p>

<p>
"My brother forgets that once the buffalo are attacked
they will begin to run, and no man can tell which way they
will go."
</p>

<p>
"Then we must fight the Cheyenne?"
</p>

<p>
"So it seems, brother," he replied with truly savage
indifference.
</p>

<p>
Chatanskah and his people were equally convinced that
there was but one way out of the difficulty, and they
advanced upon the opposing party at a run.  The Cheyenne,
of course, had seen us as soon as we saw them, and they
made it their business to meet us half-way.  But both bands
halted as though by command a long bow-shot apart, and
stood, with weapons ready, eyeing each other provocatively.
</p>

<p>
A curious scene!  Less than a mile away the buffalo
poured south like a living river of flesh.  There was some
tendency on the part of the outer files to edge away from
us, but the bulk of the vast herd paid us no attention
whatsoever.  They were terrifying in their numbers and
inexorable progress.  There must have been millions of
them.  And here were we, so relatively few, preparing
to dispute with an equally insignificant body the right to
slaughter some few units of their multitudes.
</p>

<p>
The chief of the Cheyenne stood forward, a giant of a
man, his arms and chest gashed by the ordeals of the Sun
Dance.
</p>

<p>
"Why do the Dakota interfere with the hunting of the
Cheyenne?" he demanded.  "Have they painted for war?"
</p>

<p>
"The Cheyenne know best whether there is war,"
retorted Chatanskah.  "It is they who interfere with the
Dakota's hunting."
</p>

<p>
"There is war only if the Dakota make it," asserted the
Cheyenne.  "The Cheyenne have pursued these buffalo for
a day.  Let the Dakota retire to their own country, and
await there the coming of the buffalo."
</p>

<p>
"Since when have the Cheyenne said what the Dakota
shall do?" flashed Chatanskah.  "My young men have an
answer ready for you."
</p>

<p>
The Cheyenne surveyed our array before replying.
</p>

<p>
"Nakuiman* sees that the Dakota have with them two
of the Mazzonka,"** he remarked.  "One of them is a large
man, but very fat.  Send him out here and let him show
the warriors if he has strength in that big belly.  Tell him
to lay aside his weapons, all save his knife, and Nakuiman
will do the same.  If he comes, Nakuiman will tear out the
Mazzonka's heart with his fingers and eat it before the
Dakota.  But the Mazzonka will not come.  He is afraid."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The Bear.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
** Iron-makers, Indian name for white men.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Chatanskah somewhat dubiously translated this speech
to Corlaer.
</p>

<p>
"The Bear is a strong warrior," he added.  "He has
counted more coups than any man of his tribe."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," said Corlaer, and putting down musket, tomahawk,
powder-horn and shot-pouch, he pulled his leather
shirt over his head.
</p>

<p>
Still Chatanskah hesitated.  As it happened, the Dakota
had never seen the big Dutchman at hand's-grips with an
enemy, and whilst they had respect for his marksmanship
and quiet sagacity they were inclined to make fun of him
behind his back because of his excessive corpulence.
</p>

<p>
"Chatanskah need not be concerned," spoke up Tawannears,
smiling.  "Our brother Corlaer is the strongest
warrior of his people.  The Cheyenne will choose a new chief
tomorrow&mdash;those who escape from the arrows of the
Dakota.  Tell Nakuiman to lay aside his weapons."
</p>

<p>
Chatanskah complied none too happily, and a young
Cheyenne warrior advanced from the ranks of his band and
relieved his chief of bow and arrows and tomahawk.
</p>

<p>
"Nakuiman waits," proclaimed the Cheyenne chief.
"The Mazzonka is not in a hurry to die."
</p>

<p>
But Corlaer shambled forward as soon as his opponent
had given up his weapons.  The Dutchman's legs wobbled
comically.  His huge paunch waggled before him as he
walked.  Fat lay in rolls and ridges all over his hairy brown
torso, and lapped in creases on his flanks.  Only those who
had seen him in action knew that beneath his layers of
blubber were concealed muscles of unhuman strength, and
that his placid exterior was a mask for a will that had never
yielded to adversity.
</p>

<p>
The Cheyenne warriors greeted him with guttural laughter,
and the Dakota pulled long faces.  Nor could I blame
them, after contrasting the outward appearance of the two
champions.  The Cheyenne was the biggest Indian I have
ever seen, well over two yards in his moccasins, with the
shoulders of an ox, clean-thewed, narrow-flanked, his legs
like bronze pillars.  He crouched as Corlaer approached
and drew his knife, circling on the balls of his feet, the
keen blade poised across his stomach in position to strike
or ward, as need arose.
</p>

<p>
Corlaer, on the other hand, had not even drawn his knife,
and his hands hung straight beside him.  He slouched along
with no attempt at a fighting posture, his whole body
exposed to the Cheyenne's knife.  The Cheyenne warriors
passed from laughter to gibes and humorous remarks&mdash;which,
of course, Corlaer could not understand&mdash;and
Nakuiman evidently decided that they were right in their
judgment, for he commenced a kind of dancing progress
around Corlaer, never coming to close quarters, hut
maintaining a constant menace with his knife.
</p>

<p>
Peter, affecting his customary manner of stolid indifference,
turned clumsily on his flat feet as the Cheyenne
circled him, making no effort to stay the quick rushes by
which his opponent gradually drew nearer and nearer.
This went on for so long that the Dakota around me
commenced to fume with rage and humiliation, whilst the
Cheyenne were convulsed with mirth.  Then Nakuiman evidently
decided to end the farce.  He bounded at the Dutchman
like a ball flung at a wall, and confident as I had been, I
experienced a moment of foreboding as that rush came.
Compact with concentrated energy, the Cheyenne drove
home his thrust so fast that we bystanders could not follow it.
</p>

<p>
But Peter could.  The Dutchman came awake as though
by magic.  His lolling stupidity vanished.  His great body
became instinct with the vitality that flowed inexhaustibly
from springs that had never been plumbed.  The Cheyenne
struck.  There was a flash of steel.  Peter's arms whipped
out.  Steel flashed again in a wide arc, and the knife soared
high in air and fell, point-down in the sod, twenty feet
away.  Remained, then, two heaving bodies.  Peter held
his man by one wrist and a forearm.  The Cheyenne was
struggling with every ounce of strength to break one of
these grips so that he might seize his foe by the throat.
Whilst I watched he stooped his head and fastened his teeth
in Peter's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
The blood spurted from the wound and a quiver convulsed
Peter's mighty frame.  But he refused to be diverted
from his purpose.  Slowly, inexorably, he applied his
pressure.  And slowly, but inevitably, the Cheyenne's straining
sinews yielded to him.  Nakuiman's left arm was forced
back&mdash;and back.  Suddenly there was a loud crack.  The
Indian yelped like an animal in pain.  The arm fell limp&mdash;and
with the swift ferocity of a cat Peter pounced on the
man's throat.
</p>

<p>
The jaws still fastened in the Dutchman's throbbing
shoulder yielded to that awful pressure.  A single gasping
cry reached us.  The Cheyenne's head sank back, and by a
marvelous coordination of effort, Peter heaved the man's
body at arm's-length over his head.  A moment he held it
there, his eyes on the ranks of Cheyenne warriors who had
laughed at him.  Then he flung it at them as though it
had been a sack of corn.
</p>

<p>
It twisted through the air, struck the ground and rolled
over and over into a huddle of inanimate limbs.
</p>

<p>
Peter shook himself, turned on his heel and walked slowly
back to us.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oof</i>," he remarked mildly.  "Dot made me sweat."
</p>

<p>
That matter-of-fact action, brought the Cheyenne to
realization of what had happened.  Carried away by the
spectacle of their chief's end, they abandoned all thought
of moderation and charged us, bow-strings twanging.  But
the Dakotas were not unprepared.  Chatanskah had fetched
along a dozen of the French firelocks, in the use of which
we had instructed his warriors, and we were able to meet
the enemy with a devastating discharge which brought them
up short.  Leaderless and doubly dismayed, they had no
fight left in them, and fled across the prairie pursued by the
fleetest young men of the band.
</p>

<p>
We were left with the pleasant task of reaping a full
toll of buffalo-meat, and the remaining Dakota, after
scalping the dead Cheyenne and congratulating Corlaer,
formed in a long line and trotted down toward the flank
of the moving herd.  The firing of the muskets had disconcerted
the outer files of its mass, but these so far seemed
to have made no impression upon the inner columns,
and the net result of their perturbation was to slow up the
herd's pace and start a confusion which was accentuated
to a horrible degree as soon as the Dakota came within
bow-shot.
</p>

<p>
Chatanskah afterward assured us that this herd must
have wandered far without encountering men because it
showed so little evidence of fear at our approach.  He was
also of the opinion that any herd of such enormous dimensions
was more difficult to stampede than a herd of comparatively
small size.  At any rate, it was several moments after
the booming twang of the bow-strings began that the herd
showed a tendency to mill and change its direction.  And
during those few moments the Dakota slew enough meat to
last their village through the Winter.  Aiming between the
ribs of the shaggy beasts they drove their flat-headed
hunting-arrows into the fat carcasses up to the feathers, and it
was seldom that two shots were required for one buffalo.
Some staggered on a ways, but any buffalo that had a
Dakota hunting-arrow in its vitals was sure to drop.
</p>

<p>
They dropped so fast and so easily that I was overcome
with a pang of horror.  It seemed ghastly, this wholesale
slaughter.  Bulls, cows, half-grown calves&mdash;but especially
cows&mdash;fell by the score.  It was a battue.  And yet it made
no impression at all upon the myriads of the herd.  As far
as we could see from horizon to horizon all was buffalo.
They surged up over one skyline and dwindled behind
another.  And the only noises they made were the low
rumbling of their countless hoofs and an indescribably
plaintive note, part bellow, part moo&mdash;before the fright took
them.
</p>

<p>
Our hunters had slain until their arms ached from pulling
the taut bows, and whilst the thousands of buffalo adjacent
to us had threshed away and striven to gallop either
backward or forward or into the heart of the mass, the mass,
itself, had given no indication of realizing that it was being
attacked.  I remember thinking that if the brutes possessed
any reasoning power they would turn upon us in their
numbers and trample us in the dust.
</p>

<p>
Instead, they fled from us.  By some obscure process of
animal instinct the warning was conveyed at last from the
minor hordes we had harried so mercilessly to their
farther-most brethren on the unseen western edge of the swarming
myriads.  One moment they were trending from north to
south like some unsoluble phenomenon of nature, an endless,
dusty procession of shaggy brown hides.  The next they had
showed us their sterns, turned westward, and were galloping
away with a deafening roar of hoofs.  It was as if the
whole world was in motion.  The dust clouds became so
dense as to hide all movement.  We stood now on the verge
of the prairie.  From our feet a brown desert stretched in
the wake of the fugitive herd, a desert of pulverized earth
in which there was not a single growing thing.
</p>

<p>
The roar of hoofs became faint in the distance.  The
dust-clouds slowly settled.  A short while afterward I came
and looked in the direction the buffalo had taken, and they
were gone.  The brown desert filled the skyline.  And all
about our Indians were busy with skinning-knives, wrapping
the choice cuts of meat in the bloody hides; and
Chatanskah was dispatching runners to bring out the full
strength of the tribe; for we had made such a killing as
seldom fell to the lot of an Indian community, and it
behooved them to lose nothing of the riches nature had thrown
in their way.  Whatever might be the lot of their brothers
in the neighboring villages, the Dakota of the Wahpeton
Council Fire knew that for this Winter at least they were
certain to abide snug and well-fed in their teepees.
</p>

<p>
Chatanskah talked of our deeds as the band clustered
about the camp-fire that night, with sentries thrown out
around the area strewn with dead buffalo to guard the spoil
against wolf and wild dog and the eagles that swooped
from the air.
</p>

<p>
"There will be much spoken of this in the Winter Count,"
he announced proudly.  "The old men will say we have
done well.  The other Council Fires will be envious.  But
remember, brothers, that it was our white brother who slew
Nakuiman with his bare hands and turned the hearts of
Cheyenne to water.  <i>Hai</i>, that was the greatest fight I ever
saw!  The Cheyenne will go home and creep under their
squaws' robes.
</p>

<p>
"And what shall we say of our white brother who broke
Nakuiman in pieces?  The Cheyenne was called The Bear.
Is not a warrior who slays a bear more than a bear?  <i>Hai</i>,
my warriors, I hear you say yes!  So let us give the slayer
of The Bear a new name.  We will call him Mahtotopah*&mdash;for
he is a bear, himself; he is Two Bears."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Two Bears.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Hai, hai</i>," applauded the circles of warriors who sat
around the fire, first the old men, outside those the
youngsters, who had names to win.
</p>

<p>
"But Chatanskah will not forget that he has promised to
guide Tawannears and his white brothers to the country of
the Teton Dakota?" reminded Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
Chatanskah shook his head sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"Chatanskah has not forgotten," he said, "but he hoped
that a bird might come and whisper in the ears of his new
brothers and tell them to stay with the Dakota.  In the Sky
Mountains you will find no sweet buffalo meat.  There are
no teepees to shield you from the wind.  Mahtotopah will
waste his strength on the rocks.  But you are brave men,
and I know you will go on until the Great Spirit calls you."

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
THE HORSE STEALERS
</h3>

<p>
Chatanskah made good his promise as soon as
the tribe had secured the spoils of the hunt.  He
collected a little band of picked warriors, presented
us with powder and lead captured from the Chippewa to
replenish the reserve stock Corlaer carried in a great
ox-horn and leather pouch, and we said good-by to the huddle
of teepees, now surrounded by high-built racks of jerking
meat and pegged-out hides in process of tanning.  The last
breath of Summer had left the air, and we were glad of the
buffalo-skin robes the Wahpeton gave us.  But there was
advantage, too, in the keen zest of the lower temperature,
for it inspired us to greater exertions, and we traveled at a
rate we could not have attained during the hot months.
</p>

<p>
Our course lay up the valley of the Missouri in a
north-westerly direction, more truly north than west, as I
discovered.  We journeyed so for many days, encountering
frequently bands of the other Dakota Council Fires,
Mdewakanton, Wahpekute, Sisseton, Yankton and Yanktonai.
Once a raiding band of Arikara, savage warriors, with
buffalo horns woven into their long hair instead of feathers,
and wolf-skin breechclouts, swooped down upon us from the
north.  But they were looking for an undefended village
to yield them the buffalo-meat they had been denied by
some perverse trick of fate, and they sheered off at the
discharge of our muskets, carrying their dead with them.
</p>

<p>
Each night we expected to awake to find the ground
covered with snow, for the Winter usually develops earlier
in these western lands than on the seacoast; but Providence
aided us, and at the end of two weeks we met a wandering
band of Yanktonai, who told us the Teton bands had crossed
the Missouri and followed westward another river bordered
by sandhills,* which entered the Missouri a day's march
ahead of us.  These Yanktonai were the first horse Indians
we saw.  They were of leaner build than the eastern Dakota,
with keen, predatory faces and a harsher speech, matchless
riders.  Their mounts, which they stole from the Southern
tribes&mdash;who in turn stole from the Spaniards&mdash;or bred from
stolen stock, were small, clean-limbed beasts, bespeaking the
Arab strain the Spaniards favor.  Their arms were the
lance in place of the tomahawk, and bow and arrow, and
they carried also a small, round shield of the thick, rugged
neck-hide of the buffalo.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
*I think Ormerod refers to the Platte.  From here on, his
account of his wanderings increases in vagueness, owing to lack of
established place names.&mdash;A.D.H.S.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Chatanskah was much concerned at the news that the
Teton had moved farther west, for he knew that his return
journey to his own villages would probably be delayed by
snow; but when we offered to relieve him of his pledge he
scouted the idea and insisted upon accompanying us as he
had promised.  And to say truth, as we penetrated
deeper into this land of incredible distances and unknown
peoples, we appreciated as we had not before the advantage
of his knowledge and protection.  The horse Indians, as we
were to learn at first-hand, were natural thieves, who stole
for the love of thieving and whose hands were instinctively
raised against all men.  To them, likewise, the name of the
Long House, which had reached even the Wahpeton, was
all but meaningless.  I am sure the Yanktonai band would
have murdered us cheerfully, if it had not been for
Chatanskah's escort.
</p>

<p>
We easily identified the river they had described to us by
its size and the white shimmer of the sandhills along the
bank.  Luckily for us the Missouri was low, and it was a
task of no difficulty to ford and swim its bed at a point
just above the other river's mouth.  But the water was
bitter cold, and we were glad to build two roaring fires and
broil ourselves between walls of flame.
</p>

<p>
The next day, and for another two weeks, we continued
up the valley of this river, having, to our no small
discomfort, to pass over many tributaries large and small.  But
the weather continued clear, without a trace of moisture or
snow.  The country, it seemed to me, sloped upward slowly,
as though climbing toward the huge mountains, which the
Indians said were the final bar to the world they knew.
We saw no people, but we passed a number of deserted
village-sites, which Chatanskah asserted to represent the
course taken by the Teton in their westward journey, probably
in search of better grazing conditions for their horse
herds.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, this proved to be the case.  Our first glimpse of
a man after we parted from the Yanktonai came as we
surmounted a hill that shouldered abruptly above the level of
the savannahs.  As noiseless as a figure in a dream, a boy
of adolescent age rode over its summit and peered down
at us with startled eyes.  A yelp rose from his lips,
and he heeled his mount up and down in confused fashion
as if not knowing which way to turn, then, shaking his fist
defiantly in our direction, galloped off down the opposite
slope.
</p>

<p>
"The Teton keep good watch," I commented.  "But why
did the boy wait to run?"
</p>

<p>
"He was signaling," explained Tawannears.  "When
we reach the hill-top you will see what he has
accomplished."
</p>

<p>
From the brow of the hill we looked down upon a broad
stretch of level grass-land.  Midway of it hundreds of
teepees clustered in concentric circles, with an opening to
the east.  Smoke curled up between the lodge-poles, and
men, women and children swarmed the streets, all staring
up at us.  A body of warriors were running from the village
toward the river, where several thousand horses were being
rounded up by the boy herd-guards, whose shrill cries came
faintly to our ears; and whilst we were still a considerable
distance away the herd was in motion toward the village,
and an imposing troop of warriors galloped to meet us, the
sunlight glinting on feather head-dresses and lance-points
and the bright beadwork of sheaths and quivers.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hai!</i>" exclaimed Chatanskah.  "The Teton have their
eyes open.  They do well to watch from the hill-top, but
if I were choosing a place to pitch my people's teepees I
would not put them under a hill which I could not see
through in the night.  However, I suppose they must have
protection for their <i>sunka wakan</i>* from the cold north
winds.  And here beneath the hill they have fine grazing
grounds and water for the taking."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Mysterious dogs&mdash;Indian name for horses.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At his advice we halted at the foot of the hill to await the
coming of the horsemen, who stormed up as though they
would ride us down.  But a little, shriveled-up old man who
rode in advance, flung out one hand with a single word of
command, and they yanked their horses to an abrupt halt,
scattering the sods right and left and flowing around us in
a circle that barred all chance of retreat.
</p>

<p>
"Hao," said Chatanskah calmly.  "Have the Teton left
the Council of the Seven Fires?  Does Nadoweiswe** forget
the face of Chatanskah?"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
** The Adder.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The little, shriveled-up chief eyed us grimly from the
back of the big horse he bestrode.  He had much of the look
of an adder, beady, bright eyes, and a trick of thrusting
out his tongue when he talked to lick around his lips.  He
spoke with a hissing sing-song accent because of the loss of
several front teeth.  And he was sudden in his actions, and
his warriors plainly feared him, although any one of them
could have tucked him under one arm.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hao</i>," he answered.  "Why did not Chatanskah send
one in advance to tell Nadoweiswe he was coming?"
</p>

<p>
"Chatanskah knew not where the Teton were camped,"
retorted the Wahpeton chief.  "This is a strange country
for my warriors.  Are the Wahpeton welcome or must they
go back and tell their brothers the Teton no longer honor
the Seven Fires?"
</p>

<p>
Nadoweiswe made an impatient gesture with his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Chatanskah talks like a child.  He comes suddenly,
without warning, and is surprised because we do not expect
him.  The Wahpeton and the Teton are brothers.  But the
Teton are not brothers to the Mazzonka I see with you."
</p>

<p>
"What enmity has Nadoweiswe for the Mazzonka?" asked
Chatanskah in surprise.  "There are none in his country."
</p>

<p>
"There was one a few sleeps ago," replied the Teton
with savage emphasis.  "He turned the hearts of my young
men to water, so that they allowed the Siksika* to run off
twenty hands** of horses the next night."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Blackfeet.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
** One hundred.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He turned in his saddle, and scowled at his warriors, and
the fear that showed in every eye was amusing.
</p>

<p>
"Cowardly squaws!" he snorted.  "They were afraid
to leave their teepees.  The white man had watered their
hearts with his medicine."
</p>

<p>
And now he transferred his scowl to Corlaer and me.
</p>

<p>
"That is why we will have nothing to do with any white
men," he concluded.  "They may be friends of the one who
bewitched my young men."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears spoke up, his ringing, musical voice in
strange contrast to the rasping tones of the old chief.
</p>

<p>
"I am Tawannears, War Chief of the People of the Long
House," he began.
</p>

<p>
Nadoweiswe looked at him with some astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hai</i>," he said, "you are a long way from your lodge,
young warrior."
</p>

<p>
"Many more moons' journey than my people have ever
traveled," admitted Tawannears.  "It is my post to guard
the Western Door of the Long House.  Tawannears has
honor in his own country."
</p>

<p>
"That may be," returned The Adder ungraciously.
"Here you are unknown."
</p>

<p>
"And Tawannears is also known in his country as the
friend of the white men," continued Tawannears.  "He is
the friend of these white men here.  They came with him
to aid him in a search.  They are his brothers."
</p>

<p>
"If they are friends of the Mazzonka who bewitched my
young men they shall go away from here," snapped Nadoweiswe,
"or I will take their scalps for my new medicine
lance."
</p>

<p>
"What was this white man like?" inquired Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"He was tall, and he wore a long black robe that reached
his moccasins.  My young men found him on the prairie,
and they galloped up to take him captive.  But he drew a
weapon from his belt and shook it at them, and a great fear
possessed them.  There was strong medicine in that weapon.
It did not make a loud noise like that."  He pointed to my
pun.  "Nor did he strike with it.  He did no more than
hold it toward them, calling something the while in a loud
voice, and their hearts turned to water, and they fled."
</p>

<p>
"What was the appearance of the weapon?" pressed
Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
The Adder crossed two fingers, and Tawannears laughed,
repeating the conversation to us.
</p>

<p>
"It was Black Robe!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," assented Corlaer.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears turned back to the Teton chief, whose eyes
had never left our faces during this interval.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Nadoweiswe," he said, "Tawannears and his white
friends know the white man you speak of.  He is our
enemy."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hai</i>," cried The Adder, "is it him you seek!"
</p>

<p>
"No," denied Tawannears, "we cannot lift finger against
him, for the Great Spirit has set his seal upon him."
</p>

<p>
A look of comprehension dawned in The Adder's face.
He nodded his head wisely.
</p>

<p>
"That was it," he said.  "The Great Spirit punished my
young men for threatening one He had set aside.  I have
known it to happen.  <i>Hai</i>, it was unfortunate!  But
perhaps we can make it up.  Chatanskah, you and your friends
are welcome.  There are seats in my teepee awaiting you.
Come, and tell us of your wanderings; for soon it will be
Winter, and we shall have nothing to do save sit around the
fire and talk of what has been."
</p>

<p>
And I am bound to say the old rascal entertained us
with savage courtesy during our progress to the village.
We asked him for additional details about Black Robe, but
all he could tell us was that the Jesuit had been seen south
of the river the one time.  Whence he came or where he
was going, the Teton could not say.
</p>

<p>
A quarter-mile short of the teepees we were held up by
the retrograde movement of the horse-herd, which was being
shifted back to the grazing grounds along the river.  The
young lads who handled it worked with consummate skill,
yet with the peculiarly cruel tactics which the Indians seem
always to practice.  They had driven the horses out of the
village circle, and were turning them south when a diversion
was created by a splendid stallion with a mottled brown and
white coat, that had eluded all attempts to maneuver him
into the ranks of the herd.  Finally one of the youngsters
raced up beside him and quirted him heavily over the flanks
with a rawhide whip.
</p>

<p>
The stallion screamed with rage, swung around on his
hind-legs and lashed out with fore-hoofs and snapping
teeth.  He missed the boy, but laid open the ribs of the
other horse, that naturally took fright, unseated its rider
and made off.  For a moment the mottled stallion stood
motionless, panting, nostrils expanded, eyes wide.  Then
he danced after the fleeing boy, heels flirting, teeth
bared.
</p>

<p>
Nadoweiswe and his warriors paused to see what would
happen next.  None of them seemed anxious to interfere,
and the love of horses that has been in my blood ever since
the boyhood I spent in the Dorset countryside gripped hold
of me.  I handed my musket to Tawannears and started
toward the stallion.
</p>

<p>
There was a thrill of interest in the group of Teton, and
Nadoweiswe called after me.
</p>

<p>
"The Teton says to stay here," translated Tawannears.
"He says <i>Sunka-wakan-Kedeshka</i>* has never been backed."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Spotted Horse.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But that was just the push I needed to send me on.  The
instant my eyes had lighted upon that herd of glorious,
half-tamed beasts my thighs had itched to clasp horse-flesh
again, and the idea that the stallion was unbroken was the
definite lure.  One gift I confess to pride in is my knack
with horses.  It comes naturally to me, and at home in
England and afterward in France, I had frequent occasion
to learn the fine points of the ménage.  Moreover, I was
fairly sure from what little I had seen of the horse Indians
up to this time that their only theory of horse-taming was
horse-breaking.  They knew nothing of the arts of conciliation
by which the most high-strung animals can be mastered&mdash;arts
which I had learned from many a Gypsy farrier to
supplement the natural ability that was born in me.  I
suspected that in the case of this stallion they had found it
impossible to do anything with him short of killing him.
</p>

<p>
I kept on, emitting a shrill whistle, which, as I anticipated,
switched the stallion's attention from the Indian boy
to myself.  He hesitated, looked from one to the other of
us&mdash;and gave the boy time to catch his own badly-scared
mount.  That was enough for the stallion.  He was after
some human on two legs, and he cantered up to me, eyes
wickedly distended, lips drawn back.  I simply folded my
arms, and waited until he was within ear-shot before I
spoke to him in a gentle, soothing tone, taking care to reveal
no trace of fear or uneasiness.  I suppose he had never
heard a kind word from a man.  It would have been contrary
to the practice of his masters.  So he was bewildered,
and he slowed up involuntarily, and sidled around me.
</p>

<p>
I made no attempt to catch him, and his curiosity
increasing, he circled me and peered into my face, careful to keep
beyond reach, for he was now more afraid of me than
vicious.  I was a new experience.  An Indian was
something that he knew would lash him or kick him or stick a
lance into him.  He didn't know what I would do.  So I
talked to him some more, using the few Dakota words I
had picked up, but aiming more to influence him by the tone
of my voice and my eyes.  And gradually I succeeded.
He came closer.  He pushed his velvet muzzle into my face,
whinnying as ingratiatingly as though I were a young
mare.  But I affected not to notice him, and talked on.
</p>

<p>
When I threw one arm around his lowered neck, his eyes
widened, but he did not bare his teeth or draw back.  When
I twisted one hand in his mane he shivered slightly, but
stood still.  I talked to him a while longer, and he quieted
down.  Then I patted his broad back, and vaulted upon it,
leaned forward quickly and whispered again in his
high-cocked ear.  He hesitated, I pressed his flanks with my
knees, jerked his mane, and he headed toward the herd.
</p>

<p>
Fifty feet from the nearest of his kind I slid from his
back, and slapped him smartly on the rump.  He turned his
head, gave me a reproachful glance and cantered quietly
up to a group of mares, taking his place as if by right
among them.  But as I walked away he flung up his head
once and sent after me a prolonged whinny of farewell,
surely as close to a human good-by as a beast could manage.
</p>

<p>
Nadoweiswe, with Chatanskah and Tawannears, rode out
from the array of warriors to meet me.
</p>

<p>
"The Adder says," Tawannears hailed me, "that he
would like to have you sit at his right-hand in his teepee.
He does not know how good a warrior you are&mdash;" the
Seneca's teeth showed in a smile&mdash;"but he is sure you
would make a great horse-stealer."
</p>

<p>
I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"What did you tell The Adder?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"I told him this was a feat I had never seen you perform
before, and I did not think that you would consent."
</p>

<p>
Nadoweiswe leaned down from his horse, and spoke
rapidly again.
</p>

<p>
"He says," Tawannears translated, "that he wishes to
recover his horses the Blackfeet stole, but that with you to
aid him he would likewise go south and raid the pastures of
the Apache and the Comanche."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him," I answered, "to have his warriors remember
that a horse does not have to be beaten to be mastered.  As
for the Blackfeet, tell him in my country they teach their
warriors to stampede an enemy's horses by firing the grass
behind them."
</p>

<p>
Nadoweiswe listened to this advice with a look of intense
admiration.
</p>

<p>
"He says," Tawannears gave me his reply, "that you
must be much wiser than you look.  He is amazed at you.
He will do what you say."
</p>

<p>
And it is a fact that during our short stay with the Teton
they honored me as their principal guest, not because I was
a warrior, or because I had displayed skill in diplomacy
such as many tribes admire, or because I was an orator.
No, the quality which they considered admirable was my
God-given talent for horse-stealing.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
THE WOLF-BROTHERS
</h3>

<p>
There were several minutes of silence in the crowded
teepee after Tawannears had finished his story.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears has made strong the heart of
Nadoweiswe," said the old Teton chief at last.  "Nadoweiswe
will tell the tale of Tawannears' search to all his young men
so that their hearts may be made strong, too.  If Nadoweiswe
were a young warrior he would offer to go on with
Tawannears and his white brothers and look for this strange
Land of Lost Souls.  But Nadoweiswe is an old man, and
he is used to riding on horses; and horses could not climb
the Sky Mountains which shut in the sun's hiding-place."
</p>

<p>
He lifted his pipe of ceremony from the ground at his
feet and lighted it with a coal plucked from the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Can Nadoweiswe tell us about the land across the Sky
Mountains?" asked Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
The little chief dropped his wrinkled, dried-apple visage
on his chest.
</p>

<p>
"No," he answered, after another interval of reflection.
"The stories of our wise men say nothing about this Land
you seek.  But my father was a medicine man, a <i>wakan
witshasha</i>.*  He was very wise.  He had traveled farther
than any of our people&mdash;although not so far as Tawannears.
And he told us the tribes beyond the Sky Mountains said
that the Great Spirit lived not far away.  He sits in a
certain place on the earth, very white and still, with his
head in the clouds.  And sometimes when he is angry he
hurls forth storms, and smoke and flame and loud noises
fill the air.  But these people never spoke of a Land of
Lost Souls."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Literally, mystery man.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Yet if the Great Spirit sits there, the Land of Lost
Souls cannot be far away," exclaimed Tawannears, with
more animation than he had yet shown.  "Nadoweiswe has
put new courage in our hearts.  Now, we can go forward,
without fear."
</p>

<p>
Nadoweiswe shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Do not go," he urged.  "See, the fire roars here in
the midst of us, but without robes we should be cold.  Any
day, perhaps today, the snow will fall.  The land will all
be white.  Death will be in the wind."
</p>

<p>
"Nadoweiswe has given us the reason why we must leave
his tepee," replied Tawannears.  "We have far to go.
Already we have lost time.  If we stayed by the Teton fires
the Winter would pass away and we should have achieved
nothing."
</p>

<p>
"We might steal many horses," argued Nadoweiswe,
with a shrewd glance at me.  "We will march south and
raid the Spanish tribes.  There is much to be done in
winter."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears smiled.
</p>

<p>
"If we can steal horses in Winter, surely we can travel
west," he said.  "It will be as cold going south as going
toward the Sky Mountains."
</p>

<p>
"But Tawannears does not understand that the Sky
Mountains contain more dangers than cold," returned the
Teton chief.  "The spirit beasts of the Underworld roam
their defiles.  They are the dwelling-place of the Powers
of Evil."
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears doubts it not," agreed our comrade.  "But
we expected such perils before we left the Long House.
Tawannears and his white brothers will journey through
the country of Hanegoategeh, if need be."
</p>

<p>
Nadoweiswe tried again.
</p>

<p>
"Stay, and you shall have half the horses we steal," he
offered, "and in the Spring I will go west with you, I and
my young men."
</p>

<p>
"It cannot be," said Tawannears.  "Our hearts will be
sore at parting with Nadoweiswe and Chatanskah and all
their people.  But we must go."
</p>

<p>
The Teton gave it up.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears and his white brothers walk to their
deaths," he said sententiously.  "The spirit beasts will
devour them.  <i>Hai</i>, it is a pity!  But we will tell your
story in the Winter Count.  You shall be remembered."
</p>

<p>
And 'tis a fact that the old chief parted from us in the
morning with as sincere evidence of regret as an Indian
could show.  He pressed upon us all the dried meat we
could carry, together with three pairs of snowshoes and
a new and more powerful bow and quiver of arrows for
Tawannears to use in hunting game, thus making it possible
for us to save our precious store of ammunition for
self-defense; and he and all his warriors escorted us to the
edge of the village.  Nor must I leave out Chatanskah and
our Wahpeton friends, whose demonstrations of affection
were equally touching&mdash;if for no other reason than because
of their stoical suppression of all signs of emotion.
</p>

<p>
But our last farewell we received after we had left the
village and were skirting the horse-herds grazing west along!
the river-bank.  I heard a whinny of delight, and
Sunkawakan-kedeshka, the mottled stallion, came trotting toward
us with his attendant band of mares.  He stopped some
distance off, with a neigh of inquiry, as if to demand why
I would not stop and play with him.  I thought for an
instant he would follow us, and so pretended to ignore him;
but when we had gone on for perhaps a mile and reached
the crest of a slight ridge he evidently lost interest and
trotted back to the herd.  The incident amused me, although
I saw in it no significance and it slipped my mind
completely as Tawannears pointed to the cold, gray aspect of
the northern sky.
</p>

<p>
"Somewhere there is snow," he commented.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," assented Corlaer.  "Andt der wind comes this
way."
</p>

<p>
The flakes commenced to fall during the afternoon, but
we were on the edge of the storm and they were never thick
enough to obscure our vision.  At night we contrived a
shelter of brushwood, and lay fairly warm beneath our
buffalo robes.  Yet we knew that in a severe storm we
should require more protection, and in the morning were
relieved to discover the snow was no more than three inches
deep with the sky above us a clear blue.
</p>

<p>
Two days afterward the belated Winter broke in earnest.
A wind like a giant's sickle howled out of the northwest,
and the snow reared a dense, white, fluttering wall a
hand's-breadth from our eyes.  It was all a man could do to lean
against the blast and keep his footing.  A yard apart we
were lost from each other.  Our voices might not carry
through the soft, bewildering thickness of it and the
shrieking of the wind overhead.
</p>

<p>
Ill-fortune had caught us in a bare valley between two
hills, and the nearest shelter we marked down before the
snow blinded us was a clump of timber a mile south.  For
this we made as best we could, stumbling and falling, never
sure of the way, the breath torn from our lungs by the tug
of the gale, the snow freezing on us as it fell, our faces
smarting from the bite of the sheer cold.
</p>

<p>
I think 'twas Corlaer's giant strength carried us to
safety.  He strode betwixt Tawannears and me, and when
one of us faltered, his arm was swift to lend support.  In
his quiet, bull-headed way, too, he found the right direction,
despite the dazing isolation, the stupefying impact of the
storm.  He saw to it that we quartered the wind, and
steered us straight to the very wood we had aimed for as the
snow blotted out our surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Here in the wood it was just as cold and dark as in the
open, and the snow sifted through the branches like the
moulting feathers of bird flocks incredibly vaster than those
that had passed over the Ohio; but the trees at least served
to break somewhat the force of the wind, and we had the
added comfort of work to do, for we knew that we could
ward off the death foretold by Nadoweiswe only if we
hastened to improvise a weather-tight habitation&mdash;no easy
task in the white darkness and the chill that seemed to
strike into the brain.
</p>

<p>
In the heart of the wood we came upon an immense
bowlder, and with our hatchets we felled a number of trees
so that they toppled across it.  They were firs, heavy with
foliage, a dense, impervious roof.  We also felled saplings
to heap up for end-walls, and fetched in many arm-loads
of pine-boughs for bedding and fire-wood.  As we worked
our blood flowed faster, and we conquered the numbing
force of the storm.  And the snow, steadily floating down,
improved our handiwork, heaping an extra roof and more
substantial walls to shut out the cold.  When we had
crawled inside, and by skillful use of a few pinches of
gunpowder induced the beginnings of a small blaze out of
damp wood we felt cheerful again.  A meal of jerked meat
and a night's rest under pine-boughs and buffalo-robes,
and we were ready to discount the continued fury of the
storm upon awaking.
</p>

<p>
Three days it snowed.  The first two days there was no
diminution in the storm's vigor, but the third day the wind
became less violent, although the snow fell uninterruptedly.
It was on the third day that we heard a far-off, mournful
howling.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Wolfs</i>," commented Corlaer.
</p>

<p>
"What are they doing?" I asked.  "Surely, in this
distemper of nature&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They are hunting," said Tawannears.  "The deer and
the buffalo cannot run away in such weather."
</p>

<p>
The howling came nearer, died in the distance.
</p>

<p>
The morning of the fourth day we wakened to a world
that was all a clean, dazzling white, snow to the depth of
a man's chest on the level, ay, and higher, and heaped into
drifts the size of young mountains in the hollows.  We in
our hut were obliged to tunnel to the surface, for the
bowlder and our artificial structure had formed a windbreak
against which the snow was piled to twice my height.  We
cut our way out gradually, taking care not to permit the
treacherous stuff to cave in upon us, fetched up our
weapons and packs, donned snowshoes and resumed our
journey.
</p>

<p>
Snowshoeing is slow work in hilly country, but we made
better going of it than the unfortunate wild things we saw on
every hand, profiting by a thaw which gradually scummed
the level drifts.  In a gulley a herd of buffalo were
buried chest-deep, some of the outer ones frozen solid, the
others subsisting by their combined animal heat.  A herd of
great deer&mdash;the bucks as tall at the shoulder as a tall
man&mdash;that Tawannears called Wapiti*&mdash;were plunging clumsily
through the crusted surface of the snow, falling forward on
their horns.  In a tiny valley which had been unusually
sheltered an immense concourse of antelope threshed about,
butting each other for the scanty food available.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Of course, Ormerod refers to the elk.&mdash;A.D.H.S.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We saw numerous bears, which Tawannears deemed
strange, saying that these beasts must have been surprised
by the sudden advent of the storm, after delaying to den-up,
as is their custom, because of the protracted fall.  A
cougar, a striped, cat-faced demon, passed us on a hillside,
belly to the snow, on the track of some quarry.  And during
the afternoon we heard at frequent intervals the wailing
cry of the wolves.  Toward dusk they came steadily nearer,
and I grew uneasy; but neither of my companions said
anything, and I did not like to seem more nervous than
they.  I held my peace until we were traversing a level
stretch of plain just short of sunset, and a torrent of
low-running gray shapes erupted over the skyline.
</p>

<p>
That indescribable, heart-shaking howl of the hungry
wolf echoed across the snow.
</p>

<p>
"Those beasts are tracking us," I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"They are wolves, brother," said Tawannears briefly.
</p>

<p>
"And they appear to know that we are eatable," I
retorted.
</p>

<p>
"They will do us no hurt," he answered with a trace of
impatience.  "There is abundant game for them to pull
down on every side."
</p>

<p>
"Then why follow us?" I insisted.
</p>

<p>
"They come our way, brother.  Why not!  Who knows
what end of the Great Spirit they serve?"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;"  I did not know what to say; occasionally
Tawannears became so Indian that I lost touch with him&mdash;"they
are wolves.  They have nothing to do with the Great
Spirit.  They are hungry."
</p>

<p>
He looked at me somberly.
</p>

<p>
"I have that here they will respect&mdash;" he tapped his
chest, where I knew he carried the wolf's-head sign manual
of his clan&mdash;"they are my brothers."
</p>

<p>
"Brothers!" I gasped.
</p>

<p>
I was myself by adoption a member of the Wolf Clan, yet
I had never thought of wolves as brothers.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," corroborated Corlaer, joining the conversation for
the first time.  "Der wolfs are broders.  Why not?"  He
used Tawannears' own words.  "Do not worry, my friendt.
They run our way.  Dot is all."
</p>

<p>
But I did worry as the shadows lengthened.  The piercing
howls seemed fairly to tremble with menace.  I thought
they were nearer at dusk than they had been in the full glare
of the sunset.  Then the early moon rose, and I saw the
gray pursuers once more, low, sinister shapes, galloping
over the snow, their broad pads seldom breaking through
the crust&mdash;and I knew they were nearer.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Aaaah-yaaah-oooo-oouuu-wh!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Long-drawn-out, it quavered upward, was sustained and
dropped off on an eerie pitch of unspeakable import.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like this," I declared, unable to restrain myself.
</p>

<p>
"What would Otetiani do?" inquired Tawannears mildly.
</p>

<p>
"Shoot them.  There seems to be no cover available."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever else happens, brother, do not shoot."
</p>

<p>
"Are we to be dragged down out in the open, then,
without raising a hand in defense?" I asked sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
"No, brother.  I have said that they will do no harm.
We have far to go yet.  We cannot camp here in the open
without wood or shelter.  Let us hurry."
</p>

<p>
I looked at Corlaer for support, but his attention was
centered on the pathless trail ahead of us, and I felt
myself outvoted.  There was nothing for it but to keep on.
Both these men I had known for years.  With them I had
tracked the Eastern Wilderness.  But never had I known
them so perverse as this night.  What folly to nourish a
belief in an absurd totemic tradition!  It was amazing.
Corlaer was a white man like myself.  Tawannears might
be red, but he was as well educated as I, according to the
white man's theory, better far than Corlaer.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oooow-woouuow-aarrrgh!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Louder and louder rose that cry of dreadful menace.
The gray shapes were now so many rustling bulks in the
moonlit darkness.  Looking back I could see eyes that
gleamed red or green as the silver light caught them, fluffy
brushes flicking high, the drive of powerful shoulders and
haunches.  They were big brutes!
</p>

<p>
I stopped abruptly, and swung musket to shoulder.  Before
I could pull trigger I heard the sucking fall of snowshoes
behind me, and Tawannears laid his hand on my arm.
</p>

<p>
"Of what avail, brother?" he asked gently.  "If you
shoot one, the others will be driven mad by the smell of
blood.  They will overwhelm you."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you mention yourself?" I snarled.
</p>

<p>
"Heed me, and they will do us no hurt," he said, ignoring
my thrust.  "They do not know.  When they learn
who we are, it will be different."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to tell me you will risk our lives on your
ridiculous heathen theory?" I demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I am trying to save all our lives, which, I fear, may be
lost if you persist, brother."
</p>

<p>
I flung the gun over my shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Have it your way," I said sullenly.  "It is on your
head."
</p>

<p>
"On my head," he agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Rocks," grunted Corlaer in front of us.
</p>

<p>
I looked up eagerly.  A few hundred yards away a cube
of rock projected from the snow dominating the country
for miles, the one break in the level of the high plateau.
</p>

<p>
"Good," said Tawannears.  "We will talk to the brothers
there.  Perhaps we can make a camp."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," assented Corlaer.  "Andt trees."
</p>

<p>
His keen eyes had identified a scraggly patch of
timber that clustered around a cleft in the side of
the rock-mass.  The moon shone on the snow-flecked,
dark-green boughs of evergreens, but for the most part
it was little better than dried-up bushes and dwarf
growths.  Yet such as it was it meant shelter and warmth
again&mdash;if we could shake off that stealthy procession of
ghostly figures behind us.  They had quickened their pace
as they sensed our approach to the rock.  The howls became
frankly savage and lustful.  Close at hand I heard the
snapping of frantic jaws.
</p>

<p>
"Don't run," urged Tawannears' voice in my ear.  "The
man on snowshoes is at a disadvantage, brother.  We have
time."
</p>

<p>
Time, but no more.  In that cold that was so severe as to
make it agony to touch fingers to steel I gained the mouth
of the rock-cleft with the sweat dribbling down my back.
And it was not the sweat of haste, but of fear.  All around
us the pattering of feet sounded like the swishing of
women's skirts in the lightly packed snow.  A half-circle of
gray figures formed, red tongues lolling over flashing white
teeth, steam rising from five-score panting chests.  Eyes
glinted like pricks of flame.  They were silent&mdash;snapping at
each other, yawning, <i>grr-rr-rrhing!</i> softly, but no more
baying their mournful challenge to the sky.
</p>

<p>
They waited.  And we waited.
</p>

<p>
"If we build a fire&mdash;&mdash;" I suggested in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Wait, brother," Tawannears replied.  "They fear a
fire."
</p>

<p>
I cursed impartially.
</p>

<p>
"Are you for saving <i>their</i> lives?"
</p>

<p>
He stood in front of me, very erect, as Indian as old
Nadoweiswe.
</p>

<p>
"Otetiani forgets that we are of the totem of the Wolf.
Their&mdash;" he gestured toward the gray half-circle&mdash;"emblem
is on my chest.  It is forbidden to slay the totem-beast of
your Clan."
</p>

<p>
"That may mean something to you, but certes, it little
interests me," I said disagreeably.
</p>

<p>
"It means much to Otetiani."  His voice was stern.
"Did not Otetiani become a member of the Wolf Clan?
Will not what he does affect not only himself, but his Clan
brothers?  Be wise.  Stay your hand.  These gray brothers
are curious and hungry, but they do not know us.  We will
tell them, and they will go away."
</p>

<p>
I laughed shortly.
</p>

<p>
"Try!" I invited him.  "My gun is loaded, and I propose
to climb a tree.  It won't be comfortable, but I'll last as
long as I can."
</p>

<p>
"Foolishness," remarked Corlaer dispassionately.  "You
watch Tawannears.  He knows."
</p>

<p>
"What?" I jeered.
</p>

<p>
"Der wolfs."
</p>

<p>
As if in acknowledgment of this remark, Tawannears
handed his musket to the Dutchman and opened his leather
shirt across his chest.  Then he stepped forward three paces,
and faced the half-circle of gray, slavering shapes, with his
arms flung wide.
</p>

<p>
"Brothers!" he began.
</p>

<p>
And I swear a whine as of interest rose from the half-circle.
</p>

<p>
"You are hungry.  You have followed a scent that was
different.  You have turned aside from the buffalo and the
deer, the antelope and the <i>wapiti</i>, to follow this different
scent.  For a long time you have tracked us.  You could
have had meat for the taking, but you must savor this new
meat that smelled different."
</p>

<p>
Not a sound from the half-circle, except the rhythmic
panting of powerful lungs.  The scores of eyes, so luminous,
so impersonally cruel, were riveted upon the orator.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears advanced another step.  He might have been
addressing the Hoyarnagowar.
</p>

<p>
"You have been wrong, brothers.  You knew not what
you did.  See!"
</p>

<p>
He stooped before them, stripping his chest to show the
wolf's head painted upon it.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears is of the totem of the Wolf.  These others
with me are of the totem of the Wolf.  We are sworn to
brotherhood with you.  We may not slay you nor eat your
meat nor wear your fur.  We are your brothers."
</p>

<p>
A big, deep-chested beast threw back his head and sent
out a mournful howl.  Others answered him.
</p>

<p>
"Go back, brothers," continued Tawannears.  "If you
touch us Hawenneyu will punish you, just as he would
punish us if we harmed you.  When there is free meat on
the trail it is not for brothers to hunt each other.  You
have done wrong, already; but you did not know.  Go
back."
</p>

<p>
And he walked directly into their ranks, and set his
open palm against the chest of the wolf that had raised
the first howl.  And the wolf bent his head and licked
the hand that rested on his chest!
</p>

<p>
"Go, brothers," repeated Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
They were gone!  I rubbed my eyes, and stared into the
darkness.  Yes, there flitted a dull, gray shape.  Snow
crunched under their pads.  A click of teeth as one snapped
at another.  Then the hunting-call of the leader, quavering
toward the stars.  <i>Yap-yap-yap!</i> in answer.  Howl and
counter-howl, yelps of discovery, the quick, rasping bay
announcing a fresh scent.  Fainter&mdash;and fainter&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
I sunk my fingers in Corlaer's bulbous arm.
</p>

<p>
"What were they?"
</p>

<p>
I felt him shrug his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Wolfs."
</p>

<p>
"Real?  Did I imagine that?"
</p>

<p>
"It may be they were spirit wolves, such as Nadoweiswe
warned us of," said Tawannears at my other side, taking
his musket from the Dutchman's charge.
</p>

<p>
I could not see his face, but his voice was serious.
</p>

<p>
"You mock me," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"Why, brother?  Who knows?  We have passed beyond
the world of men, I think."
</p>

<p>
"You touched one, did you not?" I insisted.
</p>

<p>
He considered.
</p>

<p>
"True."  He raised the hand to his nostrils, sniffed.
"And it left on me the rank wolf smell.  Yes, they were
no spirit beasts, brother, but it does not matter.  Spirit
beasts or flesh and blood, they would never have touched
me."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Why did the wild horse walk up and suffer Otetiani to
mount him?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I did not fear him or have thought to harm him."
</p>

<p>
"Otetiani speaks always with a straight tongue," said the
Seneca gravely.  "There was no fear in my heart of the
wolf brothers, nor did I think of harming them."
</p>

<p>
"But a wolf is not a horse!" I protested.
</p>

<p>
"True.  But he is our brother.  Did not Otetiani see
me show them the Clan insignia on my chest?"
</p>

<p>
"My God!" I exclaimed.  "One of us is mad!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oof</i>," remarked Corlaer, with his rare fluency.  "Nobody
is madt.  But der white man does not know eferything.
Dot is all.  Andt now we make a goodt hut andt a
fire&mdash;eh?  It is coldt.  <i>Ja</i>, I take this tree."

CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
THE MOUNTAIN THAT WAS GOD
</h3>

<p>
So far on our journey the obstacles thrown in our
path by hostile men had outweighed those opposed
by nature.  From now on the reverse was true.
The men we met were feeble savages, ignorant, superstitious,
easily put to flight.  But nature loomed as a foe of
overawing strength.  Each day brought its tests of
endurance, daring, brawn or skill.  Time meant nothing in
face of the difficulties we must conquer.  A month passed
after our escape from the wolf pack before we even sighted
the gigantic barrier of the Sky Mountains, and the passage
of their snowy summits required additional months of
effort.
</p>

<p>
But this is to gallop in advance of my story.  Yet I
scarce know how to set down in sober language the
magnitude of the forces we encountered, the supreme majesty
of that unknown country, the Godlike splendor of the
Winter scenery, the awful, silent loneliness.  And of all
the wonders that lent emphasis to our own puny might
I think the one that affected us most was the absence of
man from the plains and forests that intervened betwixt
the Teton villages and the mountains.  For months we were
companied only by the myriads of beasts that had fled the
intense cold of the heights for the milder temperature
below the timber-line.
</p>

<p>
The great deer which Tawannears called Wapiti, red
deer, antelope, buffalo, wild goats and wild sheep we saw
in millions.  We killed fresh meat with our hatchets, and
had it always at need.  They moved about the low-lands&mdash;which,
of themselves, were sufficiently high, inasmuch as
the country shelved upward, mile after mile&mdash;in search
of such food as could be afforded by tree-bark and the
herbage left beneath the snow; and in their sore want and
innocence of man they did no more than step aside from
our path and stare after us.  Of wolves we saw many and
heard some, but they never again came near us&mdash;explain
it as you choose.  For myself, I have no more to say,
being convinced by marvels I was yet to behold that
Corlaer was right past disputation when he said, "der white
man does not know eferything."
</p>

<p>
That was a Winter of unprecedented cold.  Late in coming,
it developed protracted periods of severe frost, linked
by tumultuous storms, after which the forest would be
scattered with wild things frozen in their tracks.  Taught
by experience, we became apt at seeking shelter with the
first hint that the Wind Spirits were plucking the wild
geese in the North, careful not to move across open country
unless the weather signs were favorable; and whilst this
delayed us, 'tis beyond question it preserved our lives.
With a roof, four walls and fire, men may defy nature's
worst attacks, no matter how make-shift the covering.
</p>

<p>
I said it was a month before we sighted the Sky
Mountains&mdash;but they were still many miles away.  We had
followed a fork of the river which flowed through the Teton
country.  It carried us northwest, and after several weeks
brought us within view of a range of ragged peaks, which,
at first, we took to be our immediate goal.  But the river
banded the broken country at their base, and we came
presently into a wide upland somewhat like the savannahs
that lined the Missouri.*  The ragged peaks dwindled
behind us; the horizon was empty ahead&mdash;until a day of
unusually brilliant sunshine with a cloudless sky revealed
a serrated glory in the west, cones and saddlebacks and
hulking ridges, square and round and oblong and
eccentrically-shaped rock-masses, all draped in snow.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* It seems probable that Ormerod refers here to the Medicine Bow
range and the Laramie Plains.&mdash;A.D.H.S.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A storm delayed us another week, but we picked up the
trail with light hearts, and each sunset was an inspiration
to faster progress.  It was as if a giant's paint-pots had
been upset and splashed harmoniously over the mountain-wall&mdash;soft
reds, purples, yellow, and the half-tones that
run between.  Or the Painter's mood would be different,
and they would be slung on in harsh, contrasting belts of
color that jarred your eyes.  Amazing!  And it continued
after we were at the very foot of the towering wall, poking
this way and that to find a gateway to the mystery land
beyond.  The heights close by might lose their potent spells,
but in the hazy distance, North or South, the Painter
worked his will at random.
</p>

<p>
In my youth I marched with the Duke of Berwick into
the Pyrenees.  That was child's play compared to the
undertaking we confronted.  For we had no knowledge
whatsoever of the secret of this jumbled prospect.  Forests
cloaked the mountains' lower flanks, and under the trees
the snow was heaped so deep we must have been swallowed
to suffocation but for our snowshoes.  Above the
timberline began the dominion of the rocks, and here all was
snow and ice, either smoothly slippery or treacherously
loose.  Upon our first attempt to gain a height we
precipitated a slide which carried us into the tree-tops of a
forest.  We were cripples for days.
</p>

<p>
Again and again we probed ravines and valleys in hopes
they would lead up to a practicable pass, but we passed
no more than time.  We wasted weeks on protracted
journeys which led to the brinks of precipices or
dead-walls&mdash;dangerous work as well as tiresome, for the
snow-slides were frequent and impossible to forecast.  Enough
sun on a certain spot to start a thaw, and a whole
hillside might go.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning we worked north along the base of the
range, in accordance with a theory advanced by
Tawannears that possibly the fork of the river we had followed
might break through the Sky Mountains, and when we
demonstrated this was not so he suggested that the other, or
southern fork, might do so.  Neither Corlaer nor I had a
better plan to offer, and we retraced our steps to the
south, and presently struck into a likely valley that ended
in a ramp of precipices.  So we tried again, and a third
time, always without success.
</p>

<p>
It was after this third try that we were snowed up in
a hut we threw together in a rock-hollow.  There was
nothing to do, except eat, sleep and keep the fire going.
None of us was talkative.  We were too disappointed, too
tired.  But some time in the afternoon of the second day
Corlaer woke up Tawannears and me.
</p>

<p>
"I hafe foundt der way," he announced.
</p>

<p>
"What way?" I yawned.
</p>

<p>
"Ofer der mountains."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears looked interested, but I was resentful at
being disturbed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it starts here in the hut?" I jeered.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," he answered, unmoved.
</p>

<p>
"What is in Corlaer's mind?" asked the Seneca eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Peter made up the fire before replying.  Talking was an
effort for him, and he usually required time to sort out
his words.
</p>

<p>
"We follow der animals," he said at length.
</p>

<p>
"What?" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
But Tawannears nodded.
</p>

<p>
"True.  Corlaer is right, Otetiani.  If there is a pass,
the wild things must know of it.  We have only to watch
them."
</p>

<p>
"But it is quite probable that in this weather no pass
will be practicable, especially for animals," I objected.
</p>

<p>
"Spbring is coming soon," replied the Dutchman.
</p>

<p>
"We have only to wait and watch," added Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
I had to admit that they were right.  And when the
storm blew itself out two days later, having doubled the
mountains' snow blanket, we abandoned our frontal attack
upon the barrier in favor of a reconnaissance of its
approaches.  For a week we pushed on south through the
foothills, and were finally forced to a halt by a
spur-range, which ran eastward.  Manifestly, 'twas a waste of
time to envelop this, and we retraced our steps again, by
no means so confident that Corlaer's suggestion had been
as canny as we first supposed, for we had seen not a
single indication that the animals were entering or
leaving the higher altitudes.
</p>

<p>
But at the end of this week a thaw set in which
continued from day to day.  The hillsides were soon running
with tiny rivulets.  The snow underfoot was soggy, and
packed hard.  The avalanches were worse than ever.  Every
hour or two there would be a rip and a roar and a swish
of breaking trees, and bowlders and pebbles would rain
down upon us.  It was one of these slides which was
instrumental in showing us a way across the barrier.  We had
abandoned our set path, and hugged the protecting face
of a high cliff, knowing any slide that topped it would
over-shoot us, when a mountain sheep came bounding out
of a little gulley we had passed without paying it any
special notice.
</p>

<p>
Corlaer raised his arm, and pointed.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the first animal we've seen as high as this," I
admitted.
</p>

<p>
"If we go in there we shall need more meat," said
Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
And he quickly strung his bow, notched an arrow and
loosed.  The animal dropped a scant fifty yards away, and
I ran to pick it up.  But Corlaer was close on my heels,
and he hoisted the carcass on his broad shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oof</i>," he squeaked.  "Der is still light.  We don't wait
to cut up der sheep.  We go on, eh?  <i>Ja</i>, we go on."
</p>

<p>
I nodded, and Tawannears was equally willing.  We
made no attempt to persuade the Dutchman to let us carry
the dead sheep, for neither of us could have handled it
and our equipment at the same time, especially on the
tricky footing of the snow-covered rocks, with snowshoes
to manage.  But it was no effort at all to Peter.  He strode
along after us as easily as though he had been carrying
a rabbit.
</p>

<p>
The entrance of the gulley was perhaps twenty feet
wide.  It threaded back into the hills, widening gradually,
until it turned an elbow of rock and became a respectable
defile.  The bed was strewn with bowlders of all sizes, and
with the melting snow and a trickle of water that in time
would become a fair-sized stream it was anything but a
pleasant place for walking.  The one satisfaction we had
was that the side-walls were so steep as to assure us some
protection from the eternal avalanches, our most dangerous foes.
</p>

<p>
The ascent was easy, and toward evening we rounded
another elbow and found ourselves in the throat of a
lovely rock-bound valley, locked away in the heart of
the hills.  Above it lifted peaks that pierced the clouds,
their lower flanks garbed in jade-green pine forests.  Its
floor was similarly tree-covered, but at intervals the
forest yielded to open parks, where herds of mountain goat
and sheep and antelope rooted for food beneath the snow.
In the center was a little lake, its frozen surface glinting
like a scarlet eye under the sunset glow.
</p>

<p>
Not a sound marred the magic stillness.  It was like a
picture painted on a screen, a highland solitude, which,
so far as we could determine, had never before been visited
by men.  Certes, the wild creatures were tamer than the
stags and hinds I remember to have chased as a new-breeched
younker in the deer-park of Foxcroft in Dorset,
where first I saw the light.  The blows of our axes felling
trees for a hut and the crackling of the campfire were bait
to lure them closer.
</p>

<p>
The valley was miles in length, and we reached the
opposite exit too late to pass through the next day; but
the second morning we dived into a replica of the defile
by which we had passed the eastern barrier range.  And
that night we shivered around a scanty fire in a small
area we cleared of snow amongst the rocks, fearful lest
the constricted crevice become an impasse like those that
had baffled us for months.  But fortune stood our friend,
and we emerged at high noon of the fourth day of our
wanderings upon a land of rambling foothills.  Behind
us reared the snowy peaks of the Sky Mountains, seemingly
more impassable than ever.
</p>

<p>
We had done what no man I have ever met could
fairly claim to have done.  I know there are those who
pretend to have traversed the Western Wilderness, and
would prate of marvels done and seen; but show me the
man who can make good his boast.  There are Jesuit
missioners and <i>couriers du bois</i> who have beheld the Sky
Mountains afar, but I have the word of Charles Le Moyne,
himself, that none hath come to him or his people with
such a tale as we can tell.
</p>

<p>
But again I wander from my story.  Patience, prithee!
</p>

<p>
The inanimate ferocity of nature lacks the dramatic
quality of men's individual hates and struggles, but no
achievement of my comrades and I can compare with the
battles we fought against mountain, forest and stream.
Mark you, a living opponent, man or animal, you can touch,
hurt, visibly overcome.  But what satisfaction can you
wring from nature after beating her?  None, I say, unless
it be the right to live.  You do not even know for sure
that the victory is yours until the zest of combat is long
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
A day's journey from the Western base of the Sky
Mountains we saw men again for the first time in near five
months.  They were a stunted, long-haired people, dressed
in stinking skins, who beset us with arrows as we lay
in a valley, but fled in panic at the first discharge of our
muskets, leaving one of their number with a wounded
leg.  Him we caught, but no sign of intelligence showed
on his brutal face as Tawannears put question after
question in the Dakota tongue, except when he was asked where
lay the seat of Wakanda, the Great Spirit.  Whether
he caught the meaning of the word or was cunning enough
to perceive that we were seeking a certain place, I cannot
say, but he lifted his arm and pointed to the Northwest,
with a chatter of gibberish that meant nothing to us.  So
we left him with his wound bound up and enough meat for
a day, and departed in the direction he had indicated.
</p>

<p>
I should pursue no useful purpose if I recounted in
detail our ensuing wanderings.  This country beyond the
Sky Mountains was more savage and desolate than the
Great Plains which stretched westward from the Mississippi,
and more varied in character.  We found many
minor mountain ranges, some of them not lightly to be
surmounted.  We near died of thirst on deserts of parched
grass.  We hungered amongst a weird world of jumbled
sun-baked rocks.  But always we advanced in a direction
north of west.
</p>

<p>
Usually game was easy to find.  The Indians were more
scattered than on the plains, and for the most part they
were a debased race, leading a hand-to-mouth existence,
Occasionally we were attacked, but they always ran at
the reports of our guns, and those we captured refused
even to show intelligence at the word Wakanda, so that
after a while we became discouraged, and decided that our
first prisoner had pretended recognition of it simply as a
device to be rid of us.
</p>

<p>
But we had no better course to follow, and continued
toward the northwest until we came to a considerable river
that flowed due north, with a line of hills showing dimly
in the blue distance a long way to the west.*  We decided
to make use of the river to save time and ease our weary
bodies, and repeated our expedient for crossing the
Mississippi, constructing a raft of tree-trunks bound together
with withes; but this came to pieces in the first rough
water it traversed&mdash;rough enough in all conscience&mdash;and
we went on afoot as far as a village of fishing Indians,
who possessed canoes hollowed with fire and stone hatchets
out of logs.  At my suggestion, we traded an extra knife
with these people for a small craft barely large enough to
hold us all, evaded by bare luck an attempt they made to
trap us in our sleep, and again took to the river.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
* Probably the Snake River, the border line between Idaho and
Oregon.&mdash;A.D.H.S.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As we expected, this stream, after flowing north for
several hundred miles, turned the flank of the distant
mountains we had seen and headed west.  A week later it joined
a larger stream flowing from the north, which, holding
south for a day's paddling, likewise was diverted to the
westward.*  But what interested us most was the sight of
another snowy barrier, incomparably higher than the Sky
Mountains, which gleamed in early morning or late
afternoon across the western horizon north of the river.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Undoubtedly, the Columbia.&mdash;A.D.H.S.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Another two days' paddling down-stream, and we came
abreast of an Indian village which drew an exclamation of
excitement from Tawannears.  The houses were long,
oblong structures of wood, with the smokes of many fires
rising above their roofs, buildings almost identical with
those long houses which furnished the Iroquois their
distinctive name; and a fleet of canoes put off from shore to
intercept us.  With the odds so heavy against us it seemed
foolish to fight unless we were compelled, and we put by
our paddles and waited with muskets ready to abide the
issue.  But our fears were immediately set at rest.  These
Indians were the handsomest, most straightforward race
we had seen since leaving the Dakota.  They were eager in
their signs of peaceful intent, and as eagerly beckoned
us ashore.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we go?" I asked doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" returned Tawannears, shrugging his shoulders.
"We have come far with little success.  If these
people are kind perhaps they will set our feet on the
true path."
</p>

<p>
"If they are kind," I repeated.
</p>

<p>
Peter, in the stern, swept his paddle in a curve that
steered us toward the bank.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," he grunted.  "Andt berhaps we get something
different to eat."
</p>

<p>
We had no cause to regret the decision.  These people,
who called themselves Tsutpeli,* were both kind and
considerate, and much impressed by the white skins that
Corlaer and I still possessed, despite thick coats of grease and
sunburn.  They were likewise very intelligent.  After we
had been escorted to the house of a chief, in which dwelt
the families of all his sons, and had eaten of several
different foods, in particular a large fish which I suspect
to have been a kind of salmon, besides berries and a stew
of roots, leaves and twigs&mdash;much to Peter's enjoyment&mdash;our
hosts began a humorous attempt to strike a common
ground of intercourse with us.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
*Nez Percés&mdash;although it is difficult to understand how they
got so far West.&mdash;A.D.H.S.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
They would point to various objects, and give their
names for them, then question us for ours; and we, or
rather, Tawannears, who was spokesman for us, would
reply with the Seneca terms.  In this way, in the course
of the weeks we spent in this village, we came to acquire
a working vocabulary, and were able, with the help of
signs and guess-work, to engage in simple conversations.
</p>

<p>
They told us that they had not always held the river
to the point they now occupied, but had recently conquered
it from a tribe they called the Chinook, who were notably
fine sailors and who still controlled the lower reaches where
were the best fisheries.  With some difficulty, Tawannears
made them understand the general purpose of his quest,
but all the principal men disowned any knowledge of a
Land of Lost Souls.  Very different, however, was their
reception of the legend Nadoweiswe had recounted of the
abiding-place of the Great Spirit.  Their faces lighted at
once, and Apaiopa, the leading chief, signed to us to follow
him from the lodge.
</p>

<p>
It was sunset, and the mountain wall we had discerned
to the north of the river appeared as a string of isolated
peaks, three or four of them towering in lordly majesty
above the indefinite blue outline of the lesser ridges.  The
farthest one we could see was the mightiest.  It bulked
across the horizon with the effect of a monstrous personality,
dazzling white, its crest ripping the clouds apart.
At that distance it had the look of sitting in the heavens,
detached, not earthbound.
</p>

<p>
"Tamanoas,"* said Apaiopa, pointing.  "The Great
Spirit!  The Chinook told us about Him when we came
here.  Sometimes He is angry&mdash;Bang!  Like this."  He
touched my musket.  "Sometimes He goes away into the
sky.  He is the Great Spirit!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Obviously, Mt. Rainier.&mdash;A.D.H.S.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Tawannears expelled his breath with a sigh of contentment,
and I rushed into hurried speech to restrain the
certain disappointment I felt he was laying up for himself.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, 'tis only a mountain, bigger than others,"
I said.  "Think, brother!  You will&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It may be a mountain," returned Tawannears quietly.
"But is that a reason why it may not be the Great Spirit
Himself?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," affirmed Corlaer, "if der Greadt Spbirit come to
earth, I guess he come as a mountain, eh?  <i>Ja</i>, dot's it."
</p>

<p>
I remembered the wolf brothers, and desisted in an
attempt which I knew could not succeed.  And for the
remainder of the evening Tawannears was occupied in
securing information on the route to the base of Tamanoas.
In the morning, our hosts loaded us with food and saw us
on our way.  They made no endeavor to restrain us.
Indeed, they seemed to think we could accomplish anything.
A Great Spirit, which was white, they reasoned, ought to
be glad to see two white men.  Tawannears, they
considered, would be accepted on our guarantee.  We bade
them farewell with sorrow.  They were the noblest Indians
we found beyond the Sky Mountains.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
THE ALTAR OF TAMANOAS
</h3>

<p>
We made our last camp in a glade strewn with
wild-flowers that was rimmed by one of the dingy
glaciers, hanging like out-thrust arms along the
mountain's flanks.  High overhead, several miles in the
still sky, soared the blunted cone of the summit,
silver-white at the peak, shading to a deeper tone where black
hulks of rock cropped up through the snow-mantle, and
steel-gray farther down where the ice-rivers of the glaciers
crawled beneath loads of rock-dust and pebble-bowlders,
wrenched from earth's fabric by their resistless flow.
</p>

<p>
Below the glaciers came the zone of wild-flowers, miles
and miles of them, casting their pollen into the air in
the midst of icy desolation, banding the heights with a
cincture of fragrant beauty.  Then, a mile nearer earth's
level, stood the timber-line; first, straggling dwarf growths,
bent and gnarled and twisted by the winds; behind these
the massive bulwark of the primeval forest, stout cedars
and cumbrous firs, the least of them fit for main-mast to
a King's ship, a green frame for the many-colored miracle
of the flower-fields and the white splendor above.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think to climb higher, brother?" I questioned
Tawannears, standing with arms folded, his eyes fixed
upon the summit that seemed so near in that radiant
atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis no more than a mountain," I continued gently.
"Do you not see?"
</p>

<p>
He turned somber eyes upon me.
</p>

<p>
"It looks like no other mountain Tawannears has ever
seen, Otetiani."
</p>

<p>
I waved my hand from South to North, where gleamed
a dozen peaks scarce inferior to the giant upon whose
thighs we couched.
</p>

<p>
"They are not the same," he flamed with sudden passion.
"Have not all the people we met told us that this
was the Great Spirit?  Tamanoas!"  He repeated the
name with a kind of ecstasy.  "Did Otetiani ever see
anything more like what the Great Spirit must be?  Is He,
then, a man like us&mdash;with feet and hands and a belly?  No,
He is Power and Strength and Beauty and Stillness!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," agreed Corlaer shrilly.  "Andt if we go up high
we see all der country aroundt.  Dot safes trouble.  <i>Ja!</i>"
</p>

<p>
I unsheathed my tomahawk.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," I said.  "'Tis settled.  We try for the
top.  Therefore, heed what I say.  A mountain is a jealous
foe, strong, as you have said, eke treacherous.  In France
there is a mountain like to this, which is called the White
Mountain.  Men climb it for love of danger, but they go
in parties roped together, so that if one falls, his mates
may save him.  We must cut up our buffalo-robes and
braid the strips for rope, and besides, we shall need sticks
to help us on the ice.  Also, we must make shift to climb
by daylight.  In the darkness we should slip to our deaths&mdash;if,
indeed, we do not die, in any case, which I think is
most likely."
</p>

<p>
Concern showed in the Seneca's face.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears is selfish," he said quickly.  "He thinks
only of himself.  There is no need for Otetiani and Peter
to go with me.  Let them wait here whilst I go up and
make prayer to Tamanoas."
</p>

<p>
I laughed, and Corlaer's flat visage creased in a ridiculous
simper, which was the Dutchman's idea of derisive
mirth.
</p>

<p>
"These many thousand leagues we have traveled," I
answered, "without one venturing alone.  Shall we begin
now?  I say no."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," said Corlaer.  "But we go in der morning, eh?
Tonight we eat."
</p>

<p>
In the morning we cached our muskets and spare equipment
in a hollow tree, and started up, with no more
encumbrances than our food-pouches, tomahawks, some fifty
feet of resilient hide-rope and the staves we had whittled
from cedar saplings.  Our path was obvious enough.  We
crossed the zone of the wild-flowers, skirted the glacier
which terminated in their midst in a spouting, ice-cold
stream of brown water, and found firm footing for half
a mile upon a tongue of rock.  Beyond this was a
snow-field, solid and frozen almost to the consistency of ice,
in which we were obliged to cut our steps foot by foot.
The glare was dazzling as the bright sunlight was
reflected from the smooth, sloping surface, but we won to
our objective, another rock-mass, only to discover it too
precipitous for climbing, and were forced to entrust
ourselves to the glacier, which encircled it.
</p>

<p>
Here was work to try our souls.  The dull, dirt-hued
ice-river was riven by cracks and crevices, some a few
inches wide, others impassable, from whose dark-green
depths came faint tinklings, and blasts of that utter cold
that numbs life instantly.  But it was not cold on the
glacier's top.  The warm sun made us sweat as we toiled
upward, testing the ice in front of us with our sticks at
every step, studying ways to evade the widest crevices,
aiding each other to leap those where there was substantial
footing on either side.
</p>

<p>
But the hour came when a great, spreading crack that
struck diagonally across it compelled us to abandon the
glacier as a highway.  We clambered laboriously over the
side walls of bowlders it had built in the ages of its descent,
and assailed another snow-field, aiming for a series of
rock-ledges which lifted, one above the other, toward the
summit.  The air was like wine, heady, yet strangely thin,
and we began to pant out of all proportion to our efforts.
Tawannears and Peter, both of them stronger than I,
seemed to feel it more; and I was startled to see the big
Dutchman sink to his knees.
</p>

<p>
"I bleed," he gasped.  "Who strikes us, eh!"
</p>

<p>
Tawannears, too, dashed a flux of blood from his nose
and collapsed on the snow.
</p>

<p>
"Tamanoas is displeased," he muttered as I stooped
beside him.  "Otetiani was right!  We die."
</p>

<p>
His bronze face was ghastly pale, and for a moment I
feared he would faint; but he rallied when I shook him by
the arm.  I was worried more for him than for Peter, in
which respect I erred.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis not Tamanoas," I urged.  "At least, brother,
'tis no more than ordinary mountain sickness I have often
heard men tell of.  Up here, above the world, the air
is lighter than we are wont to breathe.  We have gone
too fast.  Let us rest, and grow used to it."
</p>

<p>
He accepted the explanation with the illogical combination
of civilization and barbarism which was the key to
his extraordinary character.
</p>

<p>
"Peter," he grunted, pointing weakly.
</p>

<p>
I looked around to find the Dutchman in a dead faint,
the blood trickling from mouth and nose, to all appearances
dying.  But after I had bathed his temples with snow for
a short while he struggled to a sitting position.
</p>

<p>
"Who shoots us?" he quavered.
</p>

<p>
I explained the phenomenon to him as simply as I could&mdash;he
was actually more ignorant of physics than the Seneca&mdash;and
once he had comprehended its significance he was
for continuing the ascent immediately; but upon my
insistence agreed to allow his body an opportunity to
readjust itself to the new strains upon it.  We occupied the
enforced rest by examining the country disclosed to us at
this height, a panorama of dense forests and snowy peaks,
and westward, in the distance, a winding body of water,
too broad for a river, too irregular for a lake.*  But
nowhere a sign of habitation, of beings, human or otherwise,
who might have enjoyed this land of natural happiness and
plenty.  Indeed, 'twas avoided by the surrounding savages
as the abode of that divinity they visualized in the snowy
majesty of the mountain, Tamanoas.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Apparently, Puget Sound.&mdash;A.D.H.S.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Tawannears rose first, a look of grim determination in
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"The sun is high, brothers," he said.  "If Corlaer's pain
is gone&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oof!</i>" interrupted the Dutchman, with the distaste of
any man of abnormal physique for admitting weakness.
"We go to der top now.  If der air is thin I hafe fat,
eh?  Dot's enough.  <i>Ja</i>."
</p>

<p>
To us, then, it seemed as though the summit was at most
an hour's climb away, but actually our stiffest effort was
ahead of us.  All of that weary afternoon we climbed,
risking precipice and crevice, pausing at frequent intervals
for the rest that was essential, if we were not to become
light headed and dizzy.  Once we slipped and slid a
half-mile toward death, bringing up by driving our staves
through the ice and checking gradually the impetus of our
descent.  That meant an hour's work to do over again.  We
gritted our teeth and did it.  Our moccasins were shredded
on knife-edged rocks and ice-chunks.  Our faces were
blistered by the sun-glare.  Our hands were cut and sore
from constant contact with the ice.  We had spells of
nausea.  But we went up&mdash;and up.
</p>

<p>
I was leading, head bowed, my eyes on the rocks and ice
ahead in search of the safest foot-holds, when Tawannears
touched my shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"See, brother," he exclaimed.  "Tamanoas breathes."
</p>

<p>
I looked up, startled.  The rim was several hundred
yards away, and above it floated what I took to be a cloud
low in the sky.  But there were no clouds, and I soon saw
that the mist in the air above the rim was constantly
disintegrating, constantly being replenished.  It was like the
steam that exudes from the spout of a boiling kettle.
</p>

<p>
"We shall soon learn what it means," I said.  "There is
an opening here.  Keep to the snow&mdash;the rocks are shifty."
</p>

<p>
We crossed a ramp of snow, sloping easily, and entered
a huge gap in the crest.  What a spectacle!  No, I speak
not of the view spread out around the mountain's base.
We did not look at that.  Our eyes were on the vast bowl,
a mile in breadth, that was carved in the mountain's top.
Snow filled it deep in many places, poured over the rim
through gaps such as that we stood in to form the sources
of the glaciers that twisted downward into the flower-zone
like gigantic serpents with silver tails and dingy-gray,
scale-covered coils.  But here and there over the snowy
floor were scattered groups of peculiar, black rocks out of
which jetted the steamy clouds that Tawannears had
noticed.
</p>

<p>
"Whose fires?" squeaked Corlaer.
</p>

<p>
The Seneca looked eagerly in all directions, hungry
for&mdash;&mdash;  Who can say what vague form his thoughts were
molded in?
</p>

<p>
"The Great Spirit built them," I answered.  "Ay, and
tends them this moment."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears bent doubting glance upon my face.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis so," I affirmed.  "Do you remember in the
missionary's school, talk of mountains called volcanoes?"
</p>

<p>
"But those were found only in hot countries&mdash;or so they
taught us," answered the Seneca.
</p>

<p>
"Then they taught you wrong.  I, myself, have seen
such a mountain in Italy, which is in Europe.  And here
we stand on a mountain that is&mdash;or has been&mdash;a volcano."
</p>

<p>
Corlaer jumped perceptibly.
</p>

<p>
"Volcanoes hafe fires?" he protested.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I agreed.  "Did not our Indian friends tell us
that sometimes Tamanoas exploded&mdash;made a loud noise?
That is what they meant.  Deep down, under all this ice
and snow, in the bowels of the rocks, burns the undying
fire of the world.  And I suppose 'tis not far wrong to say
the Great Spirit tends that.  From it flows all life, and is
not He the Giver of Life?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," said the Dutchman thoughtfully.  "Andt now we
go down pretty &mdash;&mdash; quick, eh?"
</p>

<p>
But I pointed to the sun dropping in the West behind
a welter of clouds, and then to the miles of icy rocks
betwixt us and the timber-line.
</p>

<p>
"What chance of coming down whole of limb in darkness?"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears spoke up before he could answer me.
</p>

<p>
"Tamanoas is&mdash;Tamanoas," he proclaimed in his
resonant voice.  "As Otetiani has said, under us burns the
fire of the Life-giver of the world.  Brothers, Tawannears
goes to make his prayer to the Great Spirit.  Surely, here
in His own abode, He will listen!"
</p>

<p>
And he strode to the nearest rock-pile whence issued
the steam of the earth-fires, and flung up his arms in the
Indians' dignified gesture of prayer&mdash;for I think it
incomparably more dignified for man to approach the Great
Spirit, in whatever form, not as a suppliant upon bended
knee, but as one who craves favor from an honorable
master.  And his voice rang sonorously again in the
rhythmic oratory of the Hodenosaunee, as he stated his
case, pleaded his hungry heart, cited his bitter need.
</p>

<p>
We could not hear his words.  They were not for us;
and we welcomed the little wind that blew into the crater,
twining his stately figure in the mist of the fumeroles and
carrying the echoing phrases over the opposite snow-banks.
But we watched him enthralled, the while the shadows
blackened on the mountain's lower flanks and a pink glow
flooded the peak around us, shooting a miniature rainbow
through the steam-clouds.  Tawannears tossed out his arms
in one final appeal, proudly, as though he had a right to
ask, then turned, with a light of exultation in his eyes,
and walked back to us.
</p>

<p>
"I think Hawenneyu opened His ears to me," he said
simply.  "My heart that was sad commenced to sing
bravely.  It grows strong.  All fear has left me."
</p>

<p>
With the approach of night the little wind became a
gale that moaned amongst the rocks.  The air, deprived
of the sun's heat, was deadly cold.  We were in the grip
of a Winter frost.  And true it is we should have died there
before morning had it not been for a steam-chamber I
found in one of the clumps of black rocks.  'Twas
unpleasantly damp, but the warmth gave us opportunity for
sleep.  We awoke in a different world.  The peak was
wrapped in a thick, moist blanket of fog.  The air that had
been briskly cold was now clammy.  Water congealed on
our foreheads.  Our hide garments were stiffened by it.
We shivered like people with marsh fever.  Our teeth
rattled as we ate our breakfast&mdash;the last food we had, for
in our ignorance we had thought to complete the ascent and
return in a single day.  Even Tawannears, uplifted by his
conviction that he had secured for his quest the aid and
endorsement of an unearthly power, was depressed by this
outlook.
</p>

<p>
Having finished our scanty meal, we fumbled our way
to the gap in the crater wall by which we had entered the
previous evening, and hesitated there, peering into the
fog.
</p>

<p>
"We have two choices," I said at length, shattering the
uncomfortable silence.  "We can stay here without food
in the dampness until the clouds are dispersed&mdash;or we
perish.  Or we can commit ourselves to the hazards of
chance in this pit-mirk and essay to go down where
yesterday we came up&mdash;with every chance, comrades, that a
misstep will hurl us all to destruction."
</p>

<p>
At that instant the fog was rent for as long as the
eye can remain open without blinking, and we caught a
fair glimpse of the flower-fields and the lordly stands of
timber those few short miles away.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go down, brothers," said Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," squeaked Corlaer.  "Here I hafe shifers in my
back."
</p>

<p>
I had been leader on the ascent, but when we came to
rope ourselves together Tawannears insisted upon going
first.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears brought you into this peril, brothers," he
declared.  "It is for Tawannears to lead you out."
</p>

<p>
So 'twas he who headed us as we scrambled down the
outer side of the crater rim.  I came next, and Corlaer,
puffing lustily, was third.  At the beginning our task was
simple.  We had only to follow the foot-holes we had
chopped in the snow-ramp under the crest, and we made
this initial stage at a rapid rate.  Below the snow-ramp
was a rock-ledge, and we negotiated this with equally
swift success; but Tawannears was confused by the
swirling gray fog and missed the chain of foot-prints that
started from the lower edge of the rocks across the next
snow-bank.
</p>

<p>
We blundered around for a time trying to find them,
and finally, in desperation, launched out upon the dim
white expanse of the snow-field, here so level that we
did not need to chop foot-holds.  When we started we had
been able to see perhaps a dozen feet ahead.  Tawannears,
in advance, was a ghostly figure in my eyes, no more
than a voice in the mist to Corlaer.  But in the middle of
this level snow-field the fog suddenly thickened to a soupy
consistency, and we all three disappeared, one from
another.  I could not see the hand I held in front of my
face.  The clouds were so dense as to seem stifling.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do, brothers?" called Tawannears in a
voice that was muffled and bodiless.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oof!</i>" grunted Corlaer behind me.  "We choke to
death here, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Bide, and give the mirk time to weaken," I advised.
</p>

<p>
We sat and waited until our garments were so saturated
with moisture as to weigh heavy upon us, and our clicking
teeth warned us of the danger of inaction.  The Seneca
rose abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears did wrong to say we should descend,
brothers," he said.  "But we will die of the cold and wet
if we stay here.  To try to climb back to the top is as
dangerous as to climb down.  We have no choice save to
continue.  If Hawenneyu has his eyes upon us we shall
live."
</p>

<p>
Ten steps farther on I bumped into his crouching figure.
</p>

<p>
"Back!" he cried fiercely.  "Here is death!"
</p>

<p>
I looked down past his feet at a blue-green gulf that
showed in an eddy of the mist and was promptly swallowed
up again.  We had wandered out upon a glacier, of which
the snow-bank was the source, and this was one of those
fathomless abysses that descended into the icy vestments
of the mountain.
</p>

<p>
Foot by foot, on hands and knees, we traced the course
of the crevice to a snow-bridge that spanned it, an arch of
icy masonry.  This Tawannears beat upon with his staff
to test its resistance.  It did not quiver, and he ventured
but upon it, whilst Corlaer and I dug our heels into the
snow and leaned back to catch him up should it bear him
down.  Presently the fog swallowed him&mdash;and his voice
hailed us announcing he had crossed.  I followed him
with celerity, and gave the word to Corlaer.  The Dutchman's
figure, distorted out of its true proportions by the
shifting mists, swam into our view, stepping cautiously
across the arch, when, without warning there was a crackle
of splitting ice, and Peter bounded into the air and dug
his heels into the very margin of the precipice's brink as
the snow-arch sank beneath his weight.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears and I gasped in horror and braced ourselves
for the shock of his fall; but he teetered back and forth
for two breaths, there on the verge of eternity, then
balanced erect and stepped toward us.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oof</i>," he remarked with shrill glumness.  "Dot time
Peter heardt der angels sing.  <i>Ja!</i>"
</p>

<p>
We worked off the top of the glacier onto a second rock-ledge,
none too sure of the direction we were taking, but
thinking mainly of escaping the treacherous network of
crevices.  But we could not have avoided the tangle of
glaciers on the mountain's sides with the sun shining to
light our way, and in the fog it was a certainty we should
stumble onto them so soon as we had reached the lower
margin of the rock-island&mdash;for that was what it really was&mdash;we
had gained.  We were encouraged, however, by an apparent
tendency of the mist to dissipate, which enabled us to
achieve almost satisfactory progress across the yawning
surface of this second stretch of glacier&mdash;probably a lower
coil of the one which had nearly trapped us above.  But
just as we were congratulating ourselves upon our success
and hoping that we should soon pass out of the cloud-bank,
the wind veered and the thick, gray blanket walled
us in again.
</p>

<p>
We kept on doggedly, now immune to fear&mdash;or rather,
fearing more the suffering of inertia.  Tawannears walked
like a blind man, tapping the ground in front of him with
his staff, and shouting to us from time to time the nature
of the ground ahead.  The descent was regular, and for
a quarter-mile or so the ice had given excellent footing.
I suppose it made him over-confident.  The mist was thinning
once more, too, and I could discern his figure, a shadow
gliding in advance of me a dozen feet away.
</p>

<p>
"The ice is broken, brothers&mdash;beware a bowlder on the
right&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He vanished!  There was a violent wrench upon the rope
hitched around my waist, and I was jerked from my feet,
clawing with all my limbs for a hold to stay me.  Small
stones and ice chunks rattled down as I slid forward.  I
felt one leg pass over a declivity, sensed that my right
arm was beating space.  Then some new force was exerted
behind me.  My descent was arrested.  I sprawled half
over the precipice, but I did not fall further, as I normally
should have done.
</p>

<p>
"Who is there?" gasped Corlaer out of the fog.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis I!  Ormerod!" I answered.  "Tawannears is over
the brink."
</p>

<p>
"Is he dead?"
</p>

<p>
I mustered courage to peer into a blue-green caldron of
writhing mist.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears!" I shouted in an oddly cracked voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, brother," he answered calmly, surprisingly near.
"I am here."
</p>

<p>
"Are you hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I am holding to the rope.  I have one foot on an
ice-shelf."
</p>

<p>
"I hear," came Corlaer's voice behind me.  "Now, you
do what I say.  I pull&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;!  First comes Ormerod.
He lets oudt der rope as he comes.  When he is safe, we
pull togedder for Tawannears.  Readty?  Oop!"
</p>

<p>
The Dutchman's breath came in great, gagging pants.
It seemed as though a dozen yoke of oxen were tugging at
that rope.  An exclamation from Tawannears warned me
that the haulage might pull him from his foot-hold on the
ice-shelf, with a resulting increase in the strain upon
Corlaer, and I managed to wriggle sideways as Peter
dragged me up, so as to release a spare coil of the
hide-rope.  The instant I had all four limbs on hard ice, I
shouted to Peter to let be, lifted myself shakily to my knees
and crawled to where he sat, with his feet propped on the
bowlder Tawannears had warned us against, taking in the
slack of the line, hand over hand.
</p>

<p>
"Now, we pull Tawannears oudt," he puffed.
</p>

<p>
I seized the line beside him, but my efforts were not what
counted.  His immense shoulders bent forward.  His
back and arm-muscles bulged through his hide shirt.
His legs braced like steel pillars against the bowlder,
luckily frozen fast to its icy bed.  And slowly, very slowly,
I was able to collect a few inches of slack.  The heavy rope
chafed against the dull, rounded edge of the precipice, but
it held is no hempen cable could have done.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears' arms appeared above the brink, clutching
for something to hold to.  Presently, the Seneca's face rose
to view&mdash;and Peter's breath came in the same regular,
explosive puffs.  Then Tawannears got one hand on a level
space, found leverage for the other.
</p>

<p>
"Corlaer has done enough," he panted.  "Hold fast!
Tawannears can bring himself up the rest of the way."
</p>

<p>
We held the line taut, the Seneca gave a heave, swung
one leg over the edge&mdash;and crawled out of danger, carefully,
inch by inch, lest the broken ice betray him a second
time.
</p>

<p>
Corlaer straightened to his feet, and released the breath
from his lungs in one mighty blast.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oof!</i>" he grunted.  "Dot was no choke."
</p>

<p>
"No joke!" I protested.  "You saved our lives!"
</p>

<p>
"Corlaer has added more to the debt which Tawannears
can never repay," said the Seneca.  "He is stronger than
the buffalo bull.  He is like the Great Tree which upholds
the sky.  Tawannears will not forget."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," mumbled the Dutchman.  "Andt now we go
down, eh?  It is not goodt here.  I hafe shifers in my
back."
</p>

<p>
We brushed the moisture from our eyelashes and started
forth anew with redoubled caution.  The mist was not
so thick, but the wind-currents were brisker, and the
clouds eddied in a way that was most perplexing.  We
succeeded in getting off the glacier onto a rock-edge, and this
fetched us to a snow-field, so steep that we must resort
again to our hatchets to cut steps for our descent&mdash;and
here, I think, the blinding mist was an advantage, for it
prevented us from being confused by the giddy depths
below.
</p>

<p>
I had just taken the lead from Tawannears to rest him
from the taxing labor of chopping out the foot-holds, when
the whole surface of the field commenced to slip.  Corlaer
lost his footing first, and was flung head over heels across
the snow, dragging Tawannears and me after him.  The
mass of snow gathered headway as it sped on, but a short
distance below the starting-point it was arrested by a
terrace in the mountain-side, and only a miniature torrent
of ice-chunks attended us on our continued descent.  For
we, probably because of our individual weight, were
bounced off the terrace, and rolled down a farther slope,
sometimes flung into each other's arms, occasionally
separated by the length of our connecting lines, anon ramming
one another in head or stomach.
</p>

<p>
How far we slid I cannot say, but it must have been
several thousand feet.  Of a sudden, the clouds around
us seemed to thin away, and we rolled out of darkness
into the comparative brilliance of an overcast day.  I had
a fleeting perception of the lowering wrack overhead,
glanced down as I turned an involuntary somersault and
perceived the wild-flower zone almost at hand, and the next
moment we were cascaded over a bluff and dropped into a
snow-drift within a quarter mile of the glade from which
we had started the ascent.
</p>

<p>
Bruised and sore, our clothing slashed to ribbons, we
were yet sound in limb, and we picked ourselves up from
the snow with feeble grins of amusement at the figures
of dilapidation we presented.  Then, limping through the
flowers to our hut, we made a fire, broiled a haunch of
green venison and crawled into a bed of sweet-smelling
cedar boughs for a sleep that lasted until after sun-up the
next morning.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
WE TURN BACK
</h3>

<p>
The sun was burning away the fog that had overlain
the country since we left the base of the Ice
Mountain, and the West breeze carried to our ears
the odd muffled booming noise that we had heard once
before that day.  As the fog lifted, the noise increased.
It was like the pounding of great waters over a cataract,
but there was no brume in the air such as marked that
of Jagara, and we were wholly at a loss until at sunset we
fought our way through the briary walls of the forest upon
the surface of an open bluff.
</p>

<p>
The booming noise was the beating of surf upon a rocky
shore.  Westward and north and south the waters rolled,
blue-green off-shore, inland a smother of foam.  The
combers came lunging in, one after the other, in an endless
succession of charges, smashing themselves into fine spray and
spume against the cliffs.  The bluff on which we stood was
spattered by them; the breeze carried a fine mist to drench
the near-by forest foliage.
</p>

<p>
"Here is a sea as vast as the Cadaraqui Lake, brothers,"
commented Tawannears, as our eyes drank in the picture.
</p>

<p>
I laughed, for a drop of the spray had reached my
mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Cadaraqui, and all this wonderful land we have
traversed, could be dropped into the bosom of this sea, and
still fail to span it," I answered.  "'Tis the South Sea,
the Pacific Ocean, which, the geographers tell us, stretches
from this western verge of our continent to the shores of
the farther Indies."
</p>

<p>
"How can Otetiani know that?" exclaimed Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"Taste it.  'Tis salt, the water of the open sea."
</p>

<p>
Both he and Peter stooped and scooped handfuls of it
from pools in the rocks&mdash;and quickly spat it out again.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," agreed Corlaer.  "Sea water.  We hafe gone to
der endt of der landt."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears nodded dispiritedly.
</p>

<p>
"We have traveled as far as men may go," he admitted.
"And we have failed.  Hawenneyu has veiled his face from
us, after all."
</p>

<p>
"We have not seen all the land," I reminded him.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," spoke up the Dutchman.  "We go sout' along
der shore, eh?"
</p>

<p>
But Tawannears made no reply.  He dragged behind us,
dejected and dismayed, as we skirted the irregular
shoreline, looking for a convenient camp site.  When we found
what we sought he aided in the routine duties of the evening,
ate his share of the meager meal which was all we could
afford, and then took his stand upon a lonely rock that
jutted out into the angry waters.  An hour later he strode
back into the circle of firelight.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears forgot that he was a grown warrior," he
announced with proud humility.  "His heart turned to
water.  He was very sad.  He was afraid.  But now he
has driven the fear out of his heart.  Whatever is worth
while the Great Spirit makes difficult to find.  We have
come a long trail, my brothers, but it may be we have
even farther yet to go.  Tawannears will not cry again
if the thorns cut his feet.  Shall we continue?"
</p>

<p>
"Until you are satisfied, brother," I said.
</p>

<p>
Peter simply wagged his big head affirmatively.
</p>

<p>
"It is good," said the Seneca.  "In the morning we will
start south.  Tawannears will take the first watch.  A spirit
bird is singing in his ear tales of the past."
</p>

<p>
That was all.  When my eyes closed he was sitting
outside the range of the firelight, his back against a
tree-trunk, his musket across his knees, his eyes fixed on the
shadows.  His disappointment must have been almost
unfathomable.  To have come so far, beyond the wildest
imaginings of his race, to have risked the legendary as
well as the absolute, to have withstood so many risks&mdash;and
then to find that it was practically all to do over a
second time!  'Twas no ordinary shock.  And he, who had
so lately achieved audience&mdash;as he supposed&mdash;with the very
spirit of Tamanoas, who had inhaled the breath of the
Life-giver, was all the more disheartened.  Yet he rallied to
the shock; he refused to yield to the disappointment.  From
his reserves of courage he mustered the strength to embark
afresh upon the quest he had been confident was approaching
a conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Two days' journey southward we were halted by the
estuary of a mighty river, and we turned inland, following
its northern bank in search of means to cross.  We passed
several deserted villages, and on the third day were
attacked from ambush by a tribe of tall, lean savages, with
heads that sloped back from the eyebrows to a peak.  They
fled from our musketry, and we pursued them into their
village of long, well-built log houses, and helped ourselves
to a dug-out canoe in repayment for the ammunition we
had expended upon them.  They stood at a distance the
while, silent and plainly fearful lest we should burn the
village, but 'twas never a point with us to do more harm
or foray goods other than need required.
</p>

<p>
Across the river and equipped with good store of smoked
fish and dried meat from the savages' huts, we skirted for
several weeks a wondrously healthy wooded country betwixt
the sea and mountains scarcely inferior in height to
those snow giants we had beheld surrounding the Ice
Mountain.  We saw or encountered Indians many times, but
they were poor creatures of less spirit than the fisher folk
by the river, and seldom offered us any hostility.  A shot
was always sufficient to scatter them.  Indeed, 'twas
observed by all of us that since we passed the Sky Mountains
we had seldom met savages as fiercely valorous as the
warrior tribes of the vast central plains.
</p>

<p>
For these first weeks we wandered aimlessly.  We had
gone as far Westward as we could, and we had not yet
determined on another definite course.  But a series of
damp winds and clinging sea-fogs such as this country
seemed disposed to, set us to figuring upon plans for
weathering the approaching Winter.  We were clad now in
the rags of garments, insufficient to withstand the cold.
Tawannears and I were gaunt from hardship, hunger and
abnormal physical effort, and if the huge cask of blubber
that covered Corlaer's bones was not diminished appreciably,
fatigue had grooved deep lines and hollows in his
flabby face.
</p>

<p>
Gone from us was the <i>élan</i> that had enabled us to dash
ourselves without thought upon the barrier of the Sky
Mountains.  We wanted rest, food in plenty, time to
manufacture new clothing.  For close on a year and a half we
had wandered thousands of miles from one side of the
continent to the other, conducting journeys such as no men
had ever attempted before&mdash;as Master Cadwallader Golden,
the Surveyor General of our Province of New York, has
assured me to be the fact, he having studied to much
advantage the available data on the geography of America.
</p>

<p>
So there came a night when we huddled close to a scanty
fire under a brush shelter and debated our future.
</p>

<p>
"When the snow comes we shall want more than this,"
I said, fingering the holes in my moccasins.  "I would we
had the buffalo robes we sacrificed on the Ice Mountain
yonder."
</p>

<p>
"Otetiani speaks wisely," agreed Tawannears.  "We do
not know what the Winter in this country will be, but it
is not a warm land.  There is always snow on the mountain-tops.
In Winter, then, the cold must be felt in the low
lands."
</p>

<p>
Corlaer, gnawing infinitesimal shreds of meat from a
bone, shrilly growled approval.
</p>

<p>
"We must have shelter," I continued.  "We must have
food in plenty.  We must take a sufficiency of meat and
peltry."
</p>

<p>
"What of the fisher-tribes?" suggested Tawannears.  "It
may be they would give us hospitality."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, and stab us separately some night whilst we slept,"
I retorted.  "I like not these people.  They have shifty
eyes.  They will not stand up in a fight.  Moreover, we
cannot speak to them, nor they to us."
</p>

<p>
Corlaer cast aside his bone with a gesture of disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Go to der mountains," he squeaked.  "In der valleys is
cofer&mdash;andt wood&mdash;andt game for der killing&mdash;andt no
odder mans."
</p>

<p>
It was true what he said.  We had proved it in our
wanderings.  The valleys at the foot of the high ranges
were the favorite haunts of all the animals.  They were
well-wooded and watered.  And the savages of these parts
seemed to shun the mountains for the tidal rivers.  In the
right valley we might expect to find as perfect living
conditions as nature afforded.  We adopted Peter's counsel,
and in the morning struck off southeast into the foothills.
</p>

<p>
The first valley we came to we rejected for lack of wood.
The second was forested, but showed no sign of attracting
over-much game.  The third was too inaccessible.  But after
a fortnight of zigzag wanderings we entered by accident
a valley which promised all the attractions we desired.
It reminded us of the vale in the Sky Mountains through
which we had crossed to their Western side.  Like that it
offered a contrast of forest and savannah.  A small river
wound down its center.  Snow-capped peaks rose all around
it.  The tameness of its wild inhabitants proved they had
never been hunted by man.
</p>

<p>
We made our camp in the neck of the miniature pass by
which the valley communicated with the outside world,
happy in the confidence that at last we were assured a
resting-place where we might forget for a season the feverish
impulses that had hurled us so far from what we each
called home.  And that night, as we shivered in the wind
that blew off the glaciers we had consolation in planning
the snug cabin we would contrive in some elbow of the
hillside, with a fireplace of mud and bowlders fetched from
the river's bed.
</p>

<p>
We cast lots the next morning, using grass-blades, long
and short, to divide the first day's work.  And it so fell
out that Tawannears must do the hunting, which was necessary
to insure us ample food and to start the collection of
hides we should need&mdash;and we were all three glad of this
because he was our best bowman, and we could not afford
to use our fast-dwindling stock of powder and lead to fill
our bellies.  Peter and I were to explore the valley's length,
especially with a view to determining a site for the cabin.
</p>

<p>
It was a glorious day, the sun shining warmly and the
wind crisp and invigorating.  Footsore and tired as we
were, we started upon our errands at a swinging lope, and
I shouted a cheery good-by to Tawannears as he disappeared
into the standing timber below the little pass, and
Peter and I undertook to climb to a narrow shelf of level
land that formed a platform midway of the valley's
gently-sloping Southern wall.  From here we could secure a
sweeping view of that side of our domain and likewise gain
some idea of the opposite wall which we intended to
examine on our way home.  Tawannears replied to me with
the hunting-whoop, and Peter joined my answering yelp.
Then we were alone, only the crackling branches underfoot
and the crashing of deer, antelope and wild sheep
in the thickets to interrupt our silent progress.
</p>

<p>
The valley was a broad ellipse in shape, and the encircling
hills were terraced by such shelves as the one we
trod.  We did not keep to it of course, but climbed down
or up as the case might be, to examine features of the
landscape.  But for the most part we held to the hillside,
for in the valley-bottom the forest trees obscured the
country twenty feet away&mdash;except in the occasional savannahs
or parks that bordered the river's banks.  I think we had
traveled all of two French leagues when we came to a
place where the shelf on the hillside became a rocky ledge,
strewn with pebbles, and a raw out-crop of rock overshadowed
it.  Peter, in the lead, hesitated, his rifle at the
trail, and sniffed the air.
</p>

<p>
"Make haste," I exclaimed impatiently.  "It grows
toward noon, and we have to compass the valley before
dark."
</p>

<p>
"I smell something," he returned.
</p>

<p>
"Smell something!" I laughed.  "Sure, man, I can
smell a dozen forest odors."
</p>

<p>
"I smell beast," said Peter gravely.
</p>

<p>
This made me laugh the more, and I thrust myself in
front of the Dutchman and took up the blind trail at a
dogtrot.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Waidt!</i>" he called after me, as I came to a shoulder
of rock that projected across the ledge.
</p>

<p>
I waved my hand in answer, and trotted blithely on
around the shoulder.  A snarl that sounded like the ripping
of a thousand sheets of sail-cloth greeted me.  Straight in
front, not twenty feet away, stood the biggest bear I had
ever seen.  We had come from downwind, so it had not
smelled us; but its little beady eyes blinked ferociously
at me as it hovered over the half-devoured body of a
mountain sheep.
</p>

<p>
In my first burst of astonishment I lost my head.
Forgetful of the ground, I jumped backward and lifted my
musket, intending to shoot the beast before it could move.
But my foot slipped on the pebbly cliff-side, my ankle
twisted under me with a stab of pain, and my musket
hurtled out of reach down-hill, leaving me crippled and
fearful lest the slightest movement should send me after
it.
</p>

<p>
The flash of the steel barrel was enough for the bear.  It
sensed that I had meant it harm; it saw me prostrate, my
fingers tugging frantically at the tomahawk sheathed at my
side.  And with a snarl that became a bellow of rage it
reared on hind-legs and waddled toward me, a fearsome
figure, taller than a tall man, thick brown fur bristling,
saliva dripping from gaping jaws, great fore-paws poised
like a boxer's arms, long, steel-tipped claws quivering out
of the immense pads.
</p>

<p>
I decided that my time had come&mdash;and then Peter
trotted around the rock-shoulder, a worried look on his
fat face.  For a bare instant the Dutchman hung paralyzed,
one foot off the ground.  The next moment his heavy musket
had leaped to his shoulder, and the flame darted from
the muzzle.  But the bear was no less quick.  It lurched
forward and to one side, ignoring me with the changeable
ferocity of its kind, and all intent upon this latest
intruder.  By doing so it took Peter's shot in the shoulder
instead of in the brain, and this served only to infuriate
it the more.  The creature's snarls were demoniacal as it
reared to its hind-feet again, and advanced at a waddling
run, heedless of the blood that streamed from the bullet-hole
in its furry hide.
</p>

<p>
"My gun, Peter!" I cried.  "Down-hill!  Never mind me."
</p>

<p>
Peter's answer was to draw knife and tomahawk, jump
over my body that was sprawled out before him and meet
the bear half-way with a whirling wheel of steel.  That
was a battle for you!  Peter, big as he was, looked small
beside the bear.  The great beast's mask overhung the
Dutchman's head, and for a moment I thought it would
snap off Peter's neck.  The cavernous mouth was distended;
the little eyes gleamed red; the jaws came together
with a click.  But Peter was not there.  With the amazing
agility that was always so out-of-place in connection with
his awkward figure he had stooped, evaded the beast's
embracing paws and ripped it down the ribs with knife
and tomahawk.
</p>

<p>
The bear howled in mingled pain and anger, slumped to
its four feet and circled its enemy&mdash;and now Peter was at
a disadvantage, for he would not leave me uncovered, and
this circumscribed the area he could maneuver over.  The
bear seemed to comprehend this.  It made a quick dash at
me, and when Peter stepped lightly betwixt us reared up
on hind-legs for the third time, and rushed at Peter,
forepaws cast wide to hug him in.  And Peter met the rush
without budging.
</p>

<p>
I expected to see the Dutchman toppled over, but he
held his ground.  The bear caught him, its furry paws, so
absurdly like a man's arms, enfolded him, their claws
ripping convulsively at his shirt and breeches.  But Peter
was busy too.  Hugged close to the big beast's body, he
was butchering for all he was worth with both his tools.
His knife worked in and out&mdash;in and out.  His hatchet in
his left hand pecked remorselessly at groin and hams.
</p>

<p>
The bear's insane growls, low, tense, rasping drones of
utter rage, became instinct with pain.  The creature yelped.
Its grip slackened, and Peter tore himself away.  But I
lay aghast at sight of the Dutchman's reeking figure.  He
had dodged the snapping jaws successfully, but no celerity
of movement had availed against those two fore-paws
working with spasmodic energy.  His back, flanks and
thighs were one mess of blood.  His tattered clothing was
in ribbons.  But he crouched unperturbed, his gaze fixed
on the bear.
</p>

<p>
"Give over, Peter!" I cried again.  "Run whilst you
can.  I will roll down the hill."
</p>

<p>
"Stay!" he croaked at me, without shifting his eyes from
his antagonist.  "I finish him dis time."
</p>

<p>
The bear felt the same way, and prowled forward on
all-fours, its roars echoing between the hillsides.  Peter,
anticipating its rush, sprang in so swiftly that his
tomahawk clattered on the lowered skull and chopped out one
of the little, red eyes.  Then the bear went mad.  So far
it had fought with the cautious circumspection of a great,
stupid man-beast, aware that it was at a disadvantage as
regards wits.  Now it simply threw itself upon Peter.
They met in a desperate clinch, as the bear heaved itself
erect, and it hacked at him with all four sets of claws,
rolling over and over on the ground, until Peter slipped free
and staggered off, wiping the blood from his eyes.
</p>

<p>
He had no time to rest, however.  The beast was on
him once more, bellowing wildly, its hide gashed and torn.
They came chest to chest in full career, Peter chopping
and stabbing, the bear champing its teeth and slashing
with its claws; and I found myself crawling toward them,
dragging my injured ankle, fighting over a yard of pebbly
slope to gain a foot of distance.  But before I could reach
them the end came.
</p>

<p>
The bear seemed to throw its weight forward with desperate
energy and Peter reeled back, exposing his throat
so that the bear bent its head and snapped for the throat.
But Peter twisted violently and the savage teeth met on
his collar-bone.  In its preoccupation with this new hold
the beast must have relaxed its grip upon him, for in
that very moment he slipped his knife home through a
gash in its ribs and reached its heart.
</p>

<p>
It tottered there, its eyes glazing slowly, whilst Peter
frantically whittled at its vitals and the blood pumped
from the hole in its side and its claws dug at him with
dying energy.  Then it slumped over on its back, dragging
Peter with it.  When I reached the two bodies they lay
in one heap, the bear's teeth still gripped in the flesh of
the Dutchman's shoulder, his knife embedded in the beast's
flank.  I pried loose the bear's teeth with my knife-blade
before the final rigor set in, and pulled Peter away as
gently as I could.  I was sure his life was oozing with
every gush of the red tide.  But he opened his eyes and
grinned up at me.
</p>

<p>
"I make me a fine robe of dot pelt&mdash;<i>Ja</i>," he squeaked
faintly.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
THE SQUAT BOWMEN
</h3>

<p>
I did what I might to staunch Peter's terrible wounds,
but that was very little.  We had no medicines and
no cloths, save a handful or two of tow-wadding for
the cleaning of our pieces.  I used this stuff to pack the
worst gashes, and bound the lips of other wounds with
strips of hide cut from my shirt that I wound about his
body.  Then I scrambled over to his musket and loaded
and fired it twice, in case Tawannears had not heard the
first report.  This much accomplished, I accumulated a
stack of twigs and damp leaves and set them alight with
my flint and steel.  I knew the plume of smoke would
attract the Seneca's eye, if his attention had been drawn by
the musket-shots, and moreover, 'twould serve to guide
him to us all the quicker.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards I made Peter comfortable as best I could,
stacking a pillow of leaves beneath his head and searching
his inert form for concealed wounds that I had missed in
my first hasty examination.  He was scratched from instep
to scalp, scarce an inch of skin left whole.  Yet he breathed,
as I convinced myself by holding my knife-blade to his
lips, and his pulse still fluttered feebly.  His heart I could
not hear.  His eyes were closed.  He had not uttered a
sound after that last expiring flicker of vitality when he
promised himself "a fine robe of dot pelt"; and I was
certain he was dying.  My one idea was to ease him out
with as little suffering as possible.
</p>

<p>
But Tawannears refused to accept my theory when he
climbed the hillside an hour later.
</p>

<p>
"Corlaer will not die today," he declared looking up
from the Dutchman's scarred body.  "Otetiani stopped the
bleeding in time."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis impossible," I protested.  "You have not seen
how dreadfully he is hurt.  And the bleeding is not
stopped."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears removed the pack I had inserted in one of
the ghastliest of the wounds in Peter's belly.
</p>

<p>
"See!" he said, holding back the flaps of flesh.  "It is
a clean wound&mdash;or it will be when I have drawn the poison
from it.  No ordinary man could have lived through this,
but Corlaer is not ordinary.  His fat has saved him.
None of these hurts goes deep enough to kill."
</p>

<p>
I joined the Seneca and probed the gashes with a knife-blade
seared in the flame.  Tawannears was correct.  In no
case had the bear's claws sliced through the overlying
blubber into the vital parts.  Such wounds would have
meant the slashing of our intestines for Tawannears or
me, but they had done no more than drain Peter of some
of the blood that always poured in a torrent through his
giant frame.  His shoulder was badly torn where the beast
had nipped him with its teeth, and we could not be certain
whether the bone was broken; but aside from loss of
blood and the chance of poisoning, here again 'twas a mere
flesh wound, more ill to look upon than to cure, as
Tawannears asserted.
</p>

<p>
"There is the chance that Peter will die," he admitted.
"Not today, but tonight or tomorrow or the day after that.
If we are to save him we must have him under cover.
We must secure herbs to dress his wounds.  We must have
warmth to fan his life-spark alight.
</p>

<p>
"Otetiani must first skin the bear here.  We shall have
need of the hide and the meat, and the fat will make grease
for a healing salve.  In the meantime, Tawannears will
seek shelter.  We must hurry, brother.  Before night we
must have him settled quietly.  He should be moved before
his mind escapes from the cloud that is over it."
</p>

<p>
When Tawannears returned he brought two young
saplings, which he had laced together with vines to form
a litter, and we rolled Peter&mdash;my swollen ankle would not
permit me to exert my full strength&mdash;upon it.  He had
also cut a stick for me so that I could hobble beside him
and be of some aid in handling the litter.
</p>

<p>
"We owe much to the bear," remarked Tawannears
grimly.  "He had a comfortable den at the foot of this
slope.  We will lower Peter to it, and then you shall clean
it whilst Tawannears hunts herbs to mingle with the
bear's grease.  If Hawenneyu's face is smiling, Corlaer
will be a whole man before the Winter's snow is gone."
</p>

<p>
It was a back-breaking task to work down-hill with that
inert weight, and most of the effort fell upon Tawannears.
But we made it, and dragged the litter slowly into the
mouth of a shallow cave under the shadow of a jutting
pinnacle of rock.  The bear had left visible traces of his
occupation in the shape of a litter of bones and filth, and
I made shift to sweep out the rock chamber with a broom of
pine-boughs, and later burned over the floor and walls
with torches of light-wood.  A fire in a convenient corner
by the entrance drove out the dampness and the lingering
beast odor, and long before Tawannears was back I had
carried water from a near-by brook that fed our little
river.
</p>

<p>
All this time Peter had not moved a muscle.  He lay
like a lump of tallow, white and wan, exactly as if he
were a corpse.  The shaking he had received in being
moved down from the ledge to this level had reopened
several of his wounds, but I contrived to staunch the blood
with bunches of leaves that Tawannears indicated to me
as possessing styptical properties, and even washed the
gore from his head and arms and torso.  I met Tawannears
as I was limping up from the brook with a second potful
of water, and he took it from my hand and directed me to
cut pine-boughs for bedding for the three of us.
</p>

<p>
Neither of us slept much that night, however, he
because there was too much to be done, I in part because of
the need to help him, and likewise because of the throbbing
of my ankle.  From the slabs of fat that I had hacked
from the bear's belly Tawannears brewed a heavy grease,
and when this had boiled to a paste he mixed with it
quantities of leaves and roots, and bits of bark shredded
fine, stirring the mess so that it might not catch fire.  It
had a fine, savory smell.  When it was of such a consistency
that the stick he used in stirring would stand upright he
withdrew it from the fire, and between us we laid bare
Peter's mangled body.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears' first thought was to wash those parts which
I had not attended to, and after that he overspread the
wounds with his salve, one by one.  Next we boiled out the
meager handfuls of tow I had used to pack the wounds
and reëmployed them for dressings, cutting up portions
of our own garments for bandages.  We cast aside the
remnants of Peter's shirt and breeches and reclad him
in Tawannears' and mine, I offering the upper and
Tawannears the nether garment, slitting them to make room for
his cumbrous form.  And lest he take cold in the night
we covered him with aromatic pine-boughs and built up
the fire to a roaring blaze.
</p>

<p>
Then, Peter being attended to, Tawannears turned his
attention to my ankle, prepared a plaster of leaves
immersed in boiling water and wrapped the whole in mud,
bidding me sleep; and when I demanded to stand my
watch, promised to awake me in due time.  But the bare
truth is that I collapsed from sheer weariness and
suffering in that hour which precedes the dawn when life
is at its lowest ebb, and I did not awaken until Tawannears
touched my shoulder as the noon sun beat into the
cavern entrance.  He put aside my protests with a smile,
and handed me a barken bowl of bear's broth.
</p>

<p>
"Drink," came Peter's voice weakly.  "Dot bear makes
goodt soup.  <i>Ja!</i>"
</p>

<p>
There across the cave the big Dutchman lay with his
eyes open again and a grin on his marred face.
</p>

<p>
"Is he&mdash;alive?" I asked in amazement.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears nodded, still smiling, and Peter's grin
broadened.
</p>

<p>
"Dis time Peter hafe der choke on you, eh?"  He shook
a feeble fist at me.
</p>

<p>
"You t'ink I die, eh?  Nein, we need bear's grease for
der Winter, dot's all."
</p>

<p>
But it was many a long week before Peter was able to
be up and out with us at our daily chores in the valley.
Most of his wounds healed rapidly, thanks to the magic
salve that Tawannears had concocted, and the healing
balsam pitch of the fir-trees; but his mangled shoulder was
stubborn, and we made him give it time.  After the first
month there were plenty of small undertakings for him
about the cave, and in his own placid fashion he was able
to keep sufficiently amused; but no other man I ever knew
would have suffered the torments Corlaer did in regaining
his health, let alone the physical strain of his struggle
with the bear, and come through alive and untouched in
sanity.
</p>

<p>
We never built the cabin we had planned, for we could
not have moved Peter with safety a second time.  Instead,
Tawannears and I sealed up the entrance to the cave with
bowlders and mud from the river, leaving a recess for
fireplace and smoke-hole.  'Twas a tight, weather-proof
habitation, the most comfortable we enjoyed upon our
travels.  But Tawannears and I were seldom within doors
except for meals and sleeping, for there was more work to
be done than we could well attend to, especially in the
opening months of Winter.
</p>

<p>
Naked as we had been before Peter's fight with the bear,
we were less covered there afterward; and we had pressing
urgency for furs to shield us from the cold.  But for
the hardihood we had acquired we must have died from
exposure during the first week, whilst we were tanning skins
of deer and sheep and drying sinews for use as thread.
If I stick to the truth, I shall admit that we made no very
careful job of that first tanning emprise.  Our wants were
too pronounced.  But later Tawannears took the pride
of his people in curing and dressing to the softness of
woven goods the store of pelts we captured.
</p>

<p>
For lack of the required materials he could not use
the Iroquois method, which I hold to be unmatchable;
but, assisted by the devices of the Plains tribes, he turned
out robes and garments that no white man could have
matched.  In place of cornmeal for the dressing process
he cooked a paste of brains and liver.  His final stage,
after soaking, scraping and dressing, was to rub the skin
over the rounded top of a tree-stump.  Squaw's work, he
called it, laughing; but it made a pelt as pliable as a woolen
shirt, and of course, 'twas vastly warmer.
</p>

<p>
We did not want for anything all Winter long.  We
killed only what we required, and the animals that swarmed
in the valley were not frightened away.  We had firewood
in abundance within twenty steps of our door.  We had
a warm, dry house.  And we found delight in manufacturing
for ourselves all manner of little utensils that we
had dispensed with on our wanderings, vessels crudely
molded in clay&mdash;Peter would have toyed with these by the
hour; barken bowls and containers; cups and knives and
spoons carved from horn.
</p>

<p>
We furnished our abode with the loving care of housewives.
We labored tirelessly over tricksy devices which
were unnecessary, merely to surprise one another.  But
in the long run we wearied of it.  The call of the unknown
country beyond the Eastern vent of the valley cast its
spell upon us.  The hunger for the untrodden trail welled
up again in our hearts.
</p>

<p>
One evening as we listened through the open doorway
to the drip of the melting snow on the lower hillsides I
broke a prolonged silence, a silence compounded of three
men's unspoken thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Peter," I said, "how many miles did you do today!"
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Aroundt der valley&mdash;how many miles I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Does your shoulder pain you?"
</p>

<p>
He flexed his arm and shoulder muscles for answer.
</p>

<p>
I bent my eyes upon Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"We have had a long rest, brother.  'Tis time we
resumed our quest."
</p>

<p>
His face lighted with the glad zest it had owned when
we first started from the Long House.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears is ready," he said.
</p>

<p>
Corlaer yawned sleepily.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," he muttered.  "We better go.  If we stay der
moss grows on us.  We better go."
</p>

<p>
We slung on our equipment and tramped out of the
valley in the morning, bound we knew not whither.  But
after beating indiscriminately through the mountains for
a week we decided to strike due east, at least, until we
discovered a reason for altering our course.  And God
knows there was no reason for heading otherwise in this
devil's country we were soon swallowed up in.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the range of snow mountains surrounding our
happy valley we traversed first a high plateau,
well-watered; but a few days' journey eastward conditions
changed.
</p>

<p>
At intervals were low ranges of mountains or hills.
Betwixt the ranges were barren plateaus or basins.
Sometimes they were covered with coarse grass.  Along the
infrequent streams were patches of dwarf timber.  But often
we tramped over bare, blistered rock or dry sand deserts,
where the wind, when it blew, scorched us like the breath
of an oven.
</p>

<p>
Many times we should have died had it not been for the
forethought of Tawannears, who, during the Winter, had
sewn up two sheepskins into water-bags.  'Twas these
saw us safe across the deserts.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning the heat was not bad, but as we
continued, and Spring turned to Summer it became severe.
The dust of these high deserts had some chemical reaction
upon the skin, and our faces were cracked and creased
with crusted blood.  Food was hard to come at, and when
we killed an antelope or deer we must take pains to jerk
every shred of meat.
</p>

<p>
Twice we thought of turning back, but we had a feeling
that this country would have to be passed before we could
gain more favorable lands, and we did not like to spoil
our record of overcoming every difficulty that offered.
So we kept on, and always, as we advanced, our privations
became more extreme, so much so, that whatever had
been our former reasons for continuing, we were now
governed rather by dread of what we had seen than by fear
of the unknown ahead.
</p>

<p>
Three months after leaving our happy valley we had
our first gleam of hope.  We were crossing a barren
country of rocks when Tawannears' keen eyes perceived the
glitter of sunlight on water.  We pressed on eagerly,
thinking of drinking without stint, of being able to bathe
our hot bodies; and as we drew nearer, our excitement
grew, for the water stretched away into the far distance,
with no visible banks or boundaries.  We concluded it
must be a lake of considerable size.
</p>

<p>
But when we rushed down to the shore and buried our
faces in the nearest pool, its water choked and burned our
throats.  'Twas bitter salt.
</p>

<p>
"Der sea again!" exclaimed Peter, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"We have gone in a circle," said Tawannears, glumly.
</p>

<p>
"We have walked for three months with our backs to
the westering sun," I cried.  "We could not have circled."
</p>

<p>
"It is another sea," said Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," agreed Corlaer, "der Spanish Sea, eh?"
</p>

<p>
But I was sure it could not be.  I had studied the
southern section of the continent fairly drawn upon Master
Golden's maps, and I was convinced we could not possibly
have reached the coast of the Mexican Gulf of the
Main.  We were thousands of miles North and West of it.
There was also the thought that we had seen no signs of
Spanish influence, had not even seen savages for months.
And finally, the water was salter than the spray of the
Western Ocean.
</p>

<p>
I suggested, then, that we follow the salt water southward,
and this proved me right, for three days' journey disclosed
it to be no more than a great lake.  We struck off to
the southeast where mountains loomed across the sky, and
were overjoyed at last to find a sufficiency of water.  But
we saw smoke-signals on the horizon, and deemed it
wisest to continue into the mountains in case the Indians
were watching us.  Our ammunition was very low, and we
could not afford to fight unless we must.
</p>

<p>
It is strange by what trivial incidents men's lives are
influenced.  Instead of turning south along the shores
of the Salt Lake we might equally as well have
turned north.  And but for the smoke-signals I have
referred to we should certainly have plunged on eastward.
In either event the issue of this story would have been
different.  Strange, indeed!  But if we speak of strangeness
in our own petty affairs, how much more strange that
that Salt Lake should be isolated a thousand miles from
the salt sea which doubtless mothered it.  After all, what
is strange?
</p>

<p>
In these mountains we discovered the easiest progress
was gained by following the channels of the streams that
flowed through them, and they carried us south of east
into a country more terrifying than the nightmare ranges
of mountains and deserts we had recently traversed.  It
was a country of monstrous plateaus intersected by
abysmal ravines, ay, sometimes many thousands of feet in
depth, so buried in the bowels of the earth that we, in
pursuing the course of a river, could scarce see the daylight
overhead.  And the rocks were most astonishingly colored,
almost as though it had been done by painters' brushes, in
lurid streaks, chromatic, dazzling.  And there was never
a tree or blade of true grass, only occasionally a few
stunted bushes, rooted in a sediment of pulverized rock.
</p>

<p>
Did I say the other was a nightmare country?  This was
far worse!  So empty, so appallingly desolate!
</p>

<p>
We were picking our way amidst the bowlders in the
bottom of one of these ravines when an arrow shattered
against a rock under Tawannears' arm.  In the same
breath Peter leveled his gun and fired, and a squat savage
came twirling down through the air and landed almost at
our feet.  Such of him as was left showed him to have been
naked, with long, lank hair and primitive weapons; and
whilst we viewed him his comrades assailed us with a
continued patter of arrows.  We hurried on, thinking to
placate them by retreat.  But we were mistaken.
</p>

<p>
They harried us all that day, and we remained awake
most of the night in fear of a surprise-attack.  In the
morning they were at our heels again.  Day succeeded day, and
they clung to us.  After their first experience they never
tried to rush us, but they were numerous and persistent and
uncannily skillful in utilizing the cover of the rocks; and
we were obliged to fire at them every so often, in order to
hold them off.  And this meant a steady drain upon our
ammunition, which compelled us to cut bullets in half and
reduce the powder-charge.
</p>

<p>
A week of this, and we lost our sense of direction, for we
had difficulty in estimating the sun's course.  We did not
know where we were or how we were heading.  Two or
three times we had emerged temporarily from the gloomy
light of ravines into wide, rocky valleys, scattered with
square, table-like rock-masses, rising abruptly from the
valley-floor.  But invariably the squat bow-men, no matter
how deadly our fire, would swarm over the valley behind us
and on both flanks and herd us into another ravine.
</p>

<p>
Two things we were thankful for.  We had enough water,
and they never attacked at night.  So confident did we
become on this last score that we abandoned attempts to
watch, and slept, all three of us, from dusk to daylight, for
we were always dog-tired.
</p>

<p>
But now we reached a ravine which was waterless.  One
of our water-skins was punctured by an arrow and useless.
The other was rapidly diminishing in contents.  Our jerked
meat was running out.  Thirst and hunger confronted us.
We were in desperate plight, and our relentless pursuers
knew it.  They crept closer and closer.  We must move as
carefully as they if we were to escape an arrow in the chest.
</p>

<p>
A charge, attended by a waste of powder and lead, drove
them back temporarily, but they had caught up with us
again when we sighted an elbow turn in the ravine ahead
of us.  They seemed to be oddly excited.  We could hear
their guttural calls from cliff to cliff, could see them
running between the bowlders and along the cliff-ledges.  They
came after us with increasing confidence, and we dodged
under their arrows and raced around the elbow of the cliff.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears was leading us, and he froze stiff at the first
glimpse of the valley below.  But it was not at the valley
he was looking.  I saw that at once.  His eyes were glued
on the figure of the shepherd maid, who stood lithely in
front of her feathered flock, bow raised and arrow on string,
challenging our approach.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
KACHINA
</h3>

<p>
She was a lissom creature, with a ruddy skin and
blue-black hair as fine-spun as silk&mdash;not coarse as is most
Indians'&mdash;bound with a fillet of serpent's-skin.  Her
dress was a robe of white cotton, edged with vivid crimson,
that was looped over her right shoulder, passed under her
left arm and belted about her waist with another band of
serpent's-skin.  It stopped short of her bare knees.  On her
feet were sandals, cleverly made of some vegetable fiber.
And all around her strutted and cackled and gobbled hundreds
of turkeys, their brazen plumage a splendid foil for
her bronze beauty.
</p>

<p>
Her arrow was aimed full at Tawannears' chest, and she
called to him with a kind of high disdain in a throaty
dialect which none of us understood.  But in the middle of
her question she caught sight of Corlaer and me, and her
lustrous brown eyes widened in an excess of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Espanya!" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
Now, in my youth, amongst many other experiences of
great and little value, I campaigned in Spain with the Duke
of Berwick&mdash;a good lord and a man of honor, albeit a
bastard&mdash;and I have some lingering knack with the Spanish
tongue.  So I called back to her.
</p>

<p>
"Not Spaniards, but Englishmen!"
</p>

<p>
Her arrow wavered from one to the other of us.
</p>

<p>
"Espanya," she repeated uncertainly.
</p>

<p>
I took a step forward, but instantly the arrow steadied,
and for the blink of an eye I thought she would loose.
</p>

<p>
"We are friends," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Stand," she ordered in broken Spanish, with a strange
accent such as I had never heard.  "What are English?
You are Spanish!  Go away!"
</p>

<p>
At that there came a yelp from the squat bowmen on our
trail, and a squad of them rained arrows on us from the
cliffs overhead.  She looked up more startled than ever.
</p>

<p>
"We are friends," I insisted.  "The bowmen pursued
us here."
</p>

<p>
"Awataba," she murmured, almost to herself.
</p>

<p>
And quick as a flash she snatched a turkey-bone whistle
from the breast of her robe and blew a keen treble note,
that seemed to slip like a knife-blade through that clear,
dry air.  She half-turned as she did so, and I seized the
opportunity to examine the valley behind her.  'Twas a
bowl in the riven plateau-country, perhaps a league wide
and twice as long.  Through it flowed a respectable stream
that issued from a ravine to the right of where we stood,
and its floor was carpeted with green fields, interspersed
with the stunted trees that were all this desert land afforded.
</p>

<p>
The whistle-blast called up dozens of men from the nearer
bank of the river, and looking closer, I saw that they had
been working in cultivated fields.  Indeed, the whole
surface of the valley appeared to be given over to cultivation.
Beyond the river, against the right-hand wall of the valley,
loomed a rounded protuberance of rock that hung from the
towering cliffs like a woman's breast.  Its top was
surmounted by a mass of walls and towers, and as the shrilling
whistles carried back the warning of the turkey shepherdess
a host of tiny figures popped out upon the roofs and
battlements.
</p>

<p>
"What place is that?" I asked curiously.
</p>

<p>
The turkey-girl replied mechanically&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Homolobi."
</p>

<p>
It meant nothing to me at the time, but afterwards I
was struck by its aptness&mdash;The Place of The Breast.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* This word, as well as most of the other bits of phraseology
which Ormerod mentions, indicates a relation between this
cliff-dwelling tribe and the present Hopi.  There is
similar evidence in
the religious customs cited.&mdash;A.D.H.S.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I started to walk forward for a better view, and the
turkey-girl promptly renotched her arrow.
</p>

<p>
"You must wait for Wiki," she announced.
</p>

<p>
"But we are friends," I declared.  "If we stay
here&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" she interrupted with more interest than
she had yet shown, gesturing with her arrow toward
Tawannears, who had not moved since first he saw her, his eyes
devouring her face in a manner most extraordinary in one
so self-contained and regardless of women as the Seneca.
</p>

<p>
"He is an Indian warrior, who has journeyed with us
from the country by the Eastern Ocean, where we English
dwell.  He is of the People of the Long House."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"You talk nonsense.  What are English?  People of the
Long House!  Do not we of Homolobi dwell in long houses?
Wiki says that all our people do so, except the Awataba,
who have been cursed by Massi* to go naked amongst the
rocks.  And what is an ocean?"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Ruler of the Dead.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
How I should have answered these very difficult questions
I don't know, but fortunately&mdash;or unfortunately&mdash;at that
moment the bowmen, the Awataba, as the turkey-girl called
them, were emboldened by our quiescence to attempt a final
charge.  They preceded it with a tempest of arrows aimed
to follow a high arc and fall on our side of the bowlders
that partially sheltered us.  One of these shafts killed a
turkey, and the herd-girl was immediately almost in tears.
Another stuck in the sleeve of Peter's shirt, and he
squeaked indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Come!  We gife der naked men a lesson, eh?  Afterward
we take der girl's friendts."
</p>

<p>
We had no choice.  Our tormenters were dodging in and
out of the rocks at the mouth of the ravine, and if we ran
from them we should present excellent marks on the open
ground of the valley floor.
</p>

<p>
Peter tumbled over one of the nearest to us, and I knocked
a poor wretch from his cliff-perch.  Tawannears, rousing
from the bewildered stupor which had overcome him, was
equally successful.  A bow-string twanged at my elbow, and
the turkey-girl pointed proudly to a savage who was making
off with her shaft in his arm.  But the Awataba refused to
lose courage as they had in every previous attack upon us;
and in ten minutes of rapid firing we exhausted our
ammunition.
</p>

<p>
I looked behind me as I fired my last shot, and was
relieved to see that several hundred men were running up
from the valley; for the naked bowmen were now at close
range, their hideous, bestial faces bobbing betwixt the rocks,
dropping from ledge to ledge in efforts to come at us in
flank.  They reached Peter first, and he surprised them by
reversing his piece and using the butt for a flail.  I imitated
him, but Tawannears preferred to trust to knife and
tomahawk, after the manner of his race.  And at intervals,
when I cleared myself of an opponent, I saw the turkey-girl,
still standing undaunted in front of her excited flock,
loosing her arrows with cold precision.
</p>

<p>
Then a flood of stinking bodies submerged me.  I went
down, and struggled to my feet again.  Gap-toothed mouths
yapped at my throat.  Squat fiends struck at me with
stone-mauls and flint knives.  But I smashed right and left with
my musket-butt, and kept my footing until Corlaer came to
my rescue, swinging his clubbed musket in one hand, his
knife in the other, ready for the few who passed its orbit.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears!" he grunted, his little pig-eyes gleaming
joyously.
</p>

<p>
Side by side we chopped our way through the smelly
mob to where the Seneca stood with his back to a bowlder,
the herd-girl crouched beside him.  Her turkeys had taken
flight at last, and she was wielding a rock-maul one of the
savages had dropped, laughing with glee as she pecked at
men who tried to attack Tawannears from the rear.
</p>

<p>
She even shook her weapon at us, as though to ask us
why we intruded.  But the fight was over, for her own
people were surging into the defile, arrows slatting on the
rocks, and the squat savages fled incontinently.
</p>

<p>
The turkey-girl tossed away the stone-maul she had used
so valiantly.
</p>

<p>
"Whoever you are," she remarked, "you are good
fighters&mdash;better than Kokyan,* I think."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The Spider.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Who is Kokyan?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
But she ignored me, as she had once before.
</p>

<p>
"What is his name!" she demanded, pointing at Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
I told her, and Tawannears, at sound of his name, suspended
cleaning his knife-blade and gave her a long look.
</p>

<p>
"Ask the maiden who she is, brother," he said.
</p>

<p>
I did so, and she answered without hesitation&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I am Kachina.* Is Tawannears a priest, too, or only
a warrior?"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The Sacred Dancer.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"He is a great chief, a war-captain," I answered.  "He
guards the Western Door of the Long House in which his
people dwell."
</p>

<p>
She pursed her lips contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"Anybody can be a warrior," she commented.  "The
warriors must have priests to pray for them and secure
them victory."
</p>

<p>
I smiled at this naïve view.
</p>

<p>
"In my red brother's country the warrior is honored
above the priest," I said.
</p>

<p>
"They must be very ignorant people," she declared.
"Like the Awataba.  Are you a priest?"
</p>

<p>
"I am a trader.  I buy and sell."
</p>

<p>
Her contempt for me was even more pronounced than
for Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"And the fat one?"
</p>

<p>
"He is a warrior, too."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry," she said royally.  "I thought you might
be great ones, priests of some far people come to sit at
Wiki's feet and hear Kokyan cast spells for Yoki*&mdash;or
perhaps to see me dance."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The Rain.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Are you a priestess?" I inquired respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"I am Kachina," she said, and her words were a rebuke.
</p>

<p>
I would have asked more, but an angry-eyed young man
in a kilt of serpent's-skins thrust himself between us and
addressed her volubly, with denunciatory gestures at us.
She replied to him as coolly as she had to me, and finally
turned away and beckoned to an older man who was leading
back the men from the fields who had pursued the squat
bowmen.  The older man issued a brief order to his followers
and walked over to our group.  Like the voluble young
man, he wore a kilt of serpent's-skins, and both of them
had their lank black hair bound with fillets of the same
material.
</p>

<p>
The two were much alike, their skins a muddy reddish
hue, their figures spare and lean and rather under-sized.
In fact, they and all the other people of Homolobi
resembled in general appearance the squat savages who had
driven us into their hands, except that they were less
muscular and had much more intelligent faces.  They were
markedly inferior in stature to the Plains tribes, and equally
superior in mental development as regards their domestic
life.
</p>

<p>
Kachina, the turkey-shepherdess, was entirely different
from the Homolobi people.  Her bronze skin had a tawny
note in it.  Her shape was exquisitely molded; her hands
and feet were small; and her features were of a clear-cut,
aquiline cast very dissimilar from the flat physiognomy of
all the others we saw.  I may as well say here, that from
these circumstances and others which we discovered I
became convinced she had a considerable proportion of
Spanish blood in her; but we never were able to secure any
definite account of her origin from Wiki, who alone knew
the truth.
</p>

<p>
The older man, after a glance of appraisal at us, engaged
in a prolonged conversation with the girl, interrupted
frequently by his younger associate; and gradually a circle of
curious townsmen formed around us.  They were all dressed
in cotton kilts of varying colors, and the vegetable-fiber
sandals, and carried bows and arrows, spears, hatchets and
knives.  Their manner toward us was non-committal rather
than hostile.  The conversation terminated abruptly when
the younger man, with a savage glance at Tawannears,
snapped a hot retort to something Kachina had said and
strode out of the circle, followed by nearly half of its
members.
</p>

<p>
The older man and the girl turned to us as though nothing
had happened.
</p>

<p>
"This is Wiki," said the girl.  "He is the High Priest
of Massi."
</p>

<p>
I bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him," I began, but Wiki himself interrupted me,
speaking in Spanish more fragmentary than Kachina's, yet
understandable.
</p>

<p>
"You are not Spanish?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Say after me: 'Go with God, most excellent señor,'"
he prescribed.
</p>

<p>
I obeyed, and took no special pains with my accent&mdash;albeit
I doubt if I had need to be more slovenly than ordinary.
However, Wiki seemed satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"You are French?"
</p>

<p>
I was surprised.  This man, then, knew something of
the outside world.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"English?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
He nodded thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you come here?" he demanded
</p>

<p>
"We were pursued by the squat bowmen the maiden
calls Awataba."
</p>

<p>
"Were you seeking Homolobi?"
</p>

<p>
He eyed me sharply as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"We had never heard of it."
</p>

<p>
"Then what are Englishmen doing here so many months'
journey from their own land?  Why do you bring this red
man with you?"
</p>

<p>
"We have been traveling, partly to forget sorrows laid
upon us by the Great Spirit, partly to see new countries."
</p>

<p>
"Have you traveled far?"
</p>

<p>
"To the coast of the Western ocean."
</p>

<p>
He nodded again.
</p>

<p>
"What the Spaniards call the Pacifico?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And this red man?"
</p>

<p>
"He is a chief of the Hodenosaunee, a great nation of
the Eastern Indians, who are allied with the English.  He
is my brother."
</p>

<p>
Wiki nodded a third time.  He was obviously a man of
unusual intellectual ability.  His face was thoughtful.  His
forehead was high, and his deep-set eyes were inscrutable.
There was about him nothing of the trickster, the charlatan,
the types of most Indian priests or medicine-men.
And plainly, he was well-informed.  He had an air of
concealing more knowledge than he admitted.
</p>

<p>
"All we ask," I continued, "is permission to rest in
your valley before we continue our journey."
</p>

<p>
An enigmatic smile flickered across Wiki's face.  He
waved an arm toward the smoke-puffs that were beginning
to spurt up from the rocks bordering the defile.
</p>

<p>
"The Awataba would not let you go as easy as that,"
he replied.  And after a moment: "If you went, you might
lead Spaniards to Homolobi."
</p>

<p>
"We have nothing to do with the Spaniards," I denied.
</p>

<p>
"You speak their language," he observed.
</p>

<p>
"So do you.  I learned it when I was in the army of the
French in Spain."
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to be all things," he remarked.  "You are
an Englishman, yet you have been a French soldier and
in Spain."
</p>

<p>
I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Why, that is true," I admitted, "but you need have
no fear of our returning here.  We have suffered too much.
Our one desire is to return safely to our own country&mdash;and
there seems little chance of that, for our powder and
lead are gone."
</p>

<p>
He tipped my powder-horn to prove my words.
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" he grunted.  "We talk too much.  Come with
me to Homolobi."
</p>

<p>
"And the Awataba?" I questioned.  "Will they make
trouble for you if we go?"
</p>

<p>
"I think not," he answered calmly.  "They are children.
They cannot harm us, and if they ravage our gardens they
know that I will make a curse against them, and they will
die of hunger when the Winter comes."
</p>

<p>
"But if we go with you will you guarantee us against
treachery?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
His eyes swept from me to Kachina, intent on our
conversation, and on to Corlaer, phlegmatically surveying the
prospect of the valley, and Tawannears, whose gaze was
still riveted on the girl's face.
</p>

<p>
"All things are as Massi wills," he returned.
</p>

<p>
"That may be," I rasped, with all the ferocity I could
muster.  "But if we are to die, we will die here in the open,
taking with us as many of you as we can slay."
</p>

<p>
The girl broke in impetuously.
</p>

<p>
"What talk is this of treachery and slaying?  Wiki said
only 'all things are as Massi wills.'  Is it likely Massi wills
your deaths when you fought in defense of the sacred
turkeys?"
</p>

<p>
Wiki smiled his shadowy, enigmatical smile.
</p>

<p>
"Stay here and risk the Awataba, if you choose," he
offered.
</p>

<p>
I don't know what I should have answered, but Tawannears
plucked my sleeve and diverted my attention.
</p>

<p>
"Ask the chief whence came the maiden, brother," he
urged.
</p>

<p>
I balked, inclined to doubt the wisdom of such personal
questions.
</p>

<p>
"Ask!" he insisted.  "Tawannears has a reason."
</p>

<p>
Wiki, himself, was attracted by the Seneca's earnest
mien, and inquired the subject of his remark.  I answered
reluctantly, but Wiki evinced no displeasure.
</p>

<p>
"Say to your red brother," he answered courteously,
"that the maiden is Kachina, the Sacred Dancer, who herds
the sacred turkeys of Massi's shrine.  She came to me once
with a message from Massi, when I fasted in the desert
seeking for knowledge of what was to come."
</p>

<p>
I repeated this to Tawannears, and he sighed, by an effort
wrenching his eyes from the maiden's face.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears thought&mdash;&mdash;  But Hanegoategeh bewitches me!"
</p>

<p>
"Have a care he does not bewitch us all to death," I
muttered fiercely.  "Must you, of all men, endanger our
lives for idle curiosity in a woman of a strange tribe?"
</p>

<p>
"What is death, brother?" returned the Seneca mournfully.
"There were times when we both prayed for it.
Shall we fear it now?"
</p>

<p>
Peter bent close to me, his lips against my ear.
</p>

<p>
"She has der look of Gahano," he murmured.  "Say no
more.  Idt is a passing fancy.  He will forget."
</p>

<p>
'Twas true.  In no way identical, yet there was about this
girl Kachina a mystic semblance of that dead priestess of
a renegade Iroquois rite, for whom Tawannears had
mourned so many years, whose memory was the mainspring
of our fantastic search, whose Lost Soul he insisted was
awaiting him in some dim land betwixt the worlds, presided
over by Ataentsic and Jouskeha, demi-gods of his heathen
pantheon.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon, brother," I said gently.  "I spoke unkindly.
My nerves are on edge.  But what shall I say to these
people?  They bid us come with them or stay here and be
finished by the naked savages who hounded us hither.
And if we go with them&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Go with them!" exclaimed Tawannears eagerly.  "Ay,
let us go!"
</p>

<p>
"Peter?"
</p>

<p>
The Dutchman yawned.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>, we better go.  I hafe a hole in my belly."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
IN HOMOLOBI
</h3>

<p>
Wiki made no comment when I announced our
acceptance of his offer of hospitality&mdash;if that was
what it was.  He merely turned on his heel and
strode off, and I was forced to extend myself to catch up
with him.  Kachina elected to accompany Tawannears and
Peter.  The remaining white-kilted men straggled back to
resume the occupations they had abandoned when the girl's
whistle blew.  Nobody paid any more attention to the
Awataba, whose smokes were rising all along the northern
cliffs.  A party of young girls were rounding up the scattered
flock of sacred turkeys, and the river-bank was dotted
with women washing clothes.  The agricultural work in the
fields was going on as if there had been no interruption.
</p>

<p>
Both banks of the river for a league or more were lined
with open gardens, and immediately beneath the Breast
on which Homolobi was built were a series of fenced
gardens and stone storehouses, easily defensible.  The nearer
we approached the village, the more remarkable it became.
Access to it was had by means of ladders and a trail which
one man could hold against an army.  Its houses, solidly
constructed of stone blocks laid in mortar, were three and
four stories in height, joined together and surrounded by a
wall that was strengthened with round and square towers.
It crowded the top of the Breast and was protected from
assault from above by a bulging protuberance in the cliff
overhead.
</p>

<p>
"Have your people lived here long?" I asked Wiki.
</p>

<p>
"Since the beginning of time," he returned sententiously.
</p>

<p>
"Have you many other villages?"
</p>

<p>
He eyed me askance a moment, then answered:
</p>

<p>
"The Spaniards and others before them have destroyed
all save ours.  Some of our brethren live under the tutelage
of Christian priests in the South, but they build their homes
upon open rocks.  We are the last of the Dwellers in the
Cliffs."*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* This amazing statement has been corroborated by scientists of
the Smithsonian Institution, who agree it is probable some of the
cliff-dwellings were inhabited in recent historic times.&mdash;A.D.H.S.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"That is why you hate the Spaniards," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Englishman.  Wherever they have gone they have
slain our people.  But for what you said to Kachina and
the fight you made to protect her and the sacred turkeys we
should have slain you instantly.  Even the Awataba had
the hardihood to pursue you, in spite of the death you dealt
them, because they supposed you were Spaniards, and they
knew that if Spaniards escaped from their country, they
would come back, bringing others with them, and in the end
slay or enslave all not of their color."
</p>

<p>
"The Spaniards have always been enemies of the English,"
I replied, anxious to propitiate him.  "It was the
English who first denied the right of the Spaniards to
exploit your country for themselves."
</p>

<p>
Have I said that Wiki had green eyes that sometimes
sparkled and again seemed to flame?  They stabbed at me
like two daggers as he remarked&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The English are white; we are red."
</p>

<p>
I said no more on that score.  The man was as intelligent
as I had first imagined, and cunning, too, possessed of
information you would scarce expect to find in this isolated
community in the heart of the great rock desert.
</p>

<p>
"We are friends," I protested, recurring to my original
argument.  "We have come amongst you practically
without arms."
</p>

<p>
"You should not have come otherwise," he retorted.
</p>

<p>
We crossed an irrigation-ditch at this point, and I
commented upon its excellent workmanship.  He nodded his
head without replying, but his manner declared as if he had
shouted it: "Fool of a white man!  Do you think your
people are the only ones who can work in stone?"
</p>

<p>
I essayed once again to draw him out.
</p>

<p>
"How is it that you have no fear of the Awataba?"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
"They are children," he answered in his earlier phrase.
</p>

<p>
"But they are many times your number."
</p>

<p>
"They fear us."
</p>

<p>
We had entered the walled enclosures at the base of the
Breast, and he waved his hand to the bursting storehouses.
</p>

<p>
"When they starve they ask us for food, and if we have
it to spare, we give them some.  They know that if they
fight us, we would never lift a hand to aid them, and they
are too ignorant to help themselves."
</p>

<p>
I had no opportunity for further conversation, for we
had come to the first of a series of ladders, each wide enough
for two people to climb it at once, propped in ledges of the
cliff-side.  Wiki went up them, hand over hand, with the
agility of a sailor.  As I put my foot upon the lowest rung
to follow him, I heard a giggle behind me, and Kachina
pushed in front, dragging Tawannears by the hand.  She
had discovered a new game, it seemed, which consisted in
her pointing to a given object and pronouncing its name in
her tongue, and then having Tawannears christen it in the
Seneca dialect.  She was going into all the details of the
ladder and the trail with him&mdash;his face a study in rapture
and sheepishness&mdash;when Wiki called down a sharp command
to her.  She sobered instantly, and raced up the
ladders after the priest, who continued beside her.
</p>

<p>
The people of Homolobi watched our ascent with grins
of amusement.  The feat looked simple enough from the
ground, but 'twas as difficult, in its way, as our climbing of
the Ice Mountain of Tamanoas.  The ladders were the
easiest part of it.  After them came several sections of
rock-trail over the swell of the Breast as far as a projection
which answered to the nipple, where another ladder led to
the topmost section of the trail, which ran at an angle up
to the entrance of the village walls, a door that Peter must
turn sideways to enter.
</p>

<p>
Inside we were in total darkness, and I experienced a
chilling fear of treachery.  But the worst that happened
to us was to crack heads and shins on unseen stairs, angles
and doorposts as we were drawn through a dingy warren
of passages.  Wiki guided me, and strangers conducted
Tawannears and Peter.  Kachina must have skipped ahead
of us, for she was the first person we identified when we
stepped suddenly out of a gloomy vestibule into the bright,
sun-smitten plaza or central space of the village.
</p>

<p>
This space was sufficiently large to accommodate all the
population of the village, which must have numbered upwards
of fifteen hundred souls.  It was surrounded by the
communal houses, in which these people lived, houses which
made the Long Houses of the Iroquois appear as primitive
as the skin teepees of the Dakota.  They rose high above
us, each story receding the depth of a room from the area
of the one below it, so as to provide a succession of unroofed
porches or verandas.  These roof-tops were crowded with
people, and several hundred men lounged in the central
plaza.
</p>

<p>
Directly opposite us and situated in a notch or recess
in the cliff-side was a building of somewhat different
proportions.  It had the same peculiar recession of the upper
stories, but instead of having four floors it had only three,
the first story being twice as high as in the adjoining houses.
There was a great doorway midway of its windowless
facade, with monstrous stone figures, creatures with the
bodies of men and the heads of fabulous beasts, entwined
with snakes, on either side.
</p>

<p>
In front of this doorway stood three people, of whom
Kachina was the least remarkable.  The one in the middle
of the group was a very fat old woman, gray-haired, with
dull, snaky eyes.  She was dressed like Kachina in a white
robe, bordered with crude red, and she held herself with
a certain conscious dignity that was imposing, whatever you
might think about her character and personal cleanliness.
</p>

<p>
On her left was the voluble young man, who had evinced
so strongly his disapproval of us after the fight; and not
content with his kilt of serpent's-skins he now had a rattlesnake
coiled around his neck, its head poised next his left
ear.  He took a step forward as we appeared in the plaza,
and began declaiming in a harsh voice, the snake at his ear
hissing an accompaniment.  Occasionally he would suspend
his oration, and pretend to stop and listen to what the
snake was telling him.  The people heard him with awe;
but I thought I surprised a look of mild cynicism upon
Wiki's face.  As for Kachina, she made no attempt to
conceal her feelings.
</p>

<p>
After the voluble young man and the snake had talked
until you could have heard the rustling of a grass-blade
she interrupted them as ruthlessly as she had me.  And she
was not content with merely saying what she thought.  She
danced it, too.  That is literally what I mean.  She would
say something, lift her eyes skyward, raise her arms in a
beseeching gesture, and then dance a slow, stately measure,
or perhaps a swift, heady one.  Betwixt dances she was
making demands of something inside the temple or arguing
with the fat old woman or with Wiki.
</p>

<p>
When she ceased the voluble young man tried to continue
his oration, but Wiki stepped to the front and cut him
off.  Then there was a four-sided debate, in which the fat
old woman joined, and presently, she raised her arms in a
gesture of invocation, blinked her eyes shut, waited&mdash;whilst
everyone, including ourselves, became tense&mdash;and ejaculated
a single sentence.  After which she reopened her eyes, and
waddled into the dark recesses of the temple, attended by
the young man, no longer voluble, but very sullen, and
hauling the snake from its embrace.
</p>

<p>
Wiki expressed no sentiment in his face or actions, but
Kachina showed delight as plainly as she had
disapprobation of the young man's suggestions, and she danced away
by herself in the direction of a narrow door in one corner
of the temple-block.
</p>

<p>
Wiki crooked his finger.
</p>

<p>
"Come," he said, and led us through another door to a
stair which fetched us to the terrace on the roof of the
fore part of the temple proper.  We crossed this roof, eyed
suspiciously by several men who wore the serpent's-skin
kilt, to a doorway opening into a room probably twelve feet
square.  It had no windows, and its walls and floor were
bare of furnishings.
</p>

<p>
"You may sleep here," Wiki announced briefly.  "Food
will be brought later."
</p>

<p>
"Are we at liberty to go out if we please?" I asked is
he was leaving.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" he returned indifferently.  "But you must
be careful.  Your faces are strange to our people."
</p>

<p>
We pondered this statement until our doubts were presently
set at rest by a visit from a party of the temple priests&mdash;the
wearers of the serpent's skin kilts&mdash;headed by the
voluble young man.  They stalked in whilst I was dressing
an arrow-cut in Tawannears' shoulder, their faces bleakly
scowling, gathered up our guns, powder-horns and shot-pouches
and walked out again.  Peter started to rise, but
sank to his haunches at a word from me.
</p>

<p>
"We better break dot feller's headt," he grumbled.
</p>

<p>
"That was what they wanted," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Otetiani is right," agreed Tawannears.  "The guns are
useless.  If we had resisted they would have made it an
excuse to kill us."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>, dot's maype true," admitted Peter thoughtfully.
"Andt what do we do now, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," I answered.  "'Tis sound strategy to hold
our hands.  This situation is still shaping.  I know not
what other powers there may be, but of the four leaders
we have seen, I think Wiki has to make up his mind about
us.  The serpent priest hates us for reasons of his own.
The old woman has given no sign.  The girl Kachina has
s fancy for Tawannears, but there is as much danger as
advantage in that.  Your feet are set upon a crooked path,
brother."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears smiled, as I had not seen him smile in years,
with a kind of glad expectancy.
</p>

<p>
"There is an echo calling in my heart, brother," he said.
"I do not yet know what it is saying, but it calls louder
and louder.  Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Kachina glided through the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Do not heed what Kokyan does or says to you," she
ordered me curtly.  "He is jealous, poor, crawling ant!
And he thinks he can spoil my plans."
</p>

<p>
"Who is Kokyan?" I queried.
</p>

<p>
She stared at me, childishly puzzled that anyone should
be no continually ignorant.
</p>

<p>
"He who has just left."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the young man with the snake?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, stupid buffalo," she derided me.
</p>

<p>
"And why is he jealous!"
</p>

<p>
She dimpled like any other girl, and dug her sandal-toe
in the dust of the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Because of me, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," I echoed.  "But he is not jealous of me,
for instance?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," she answered frankly.  "He is jealous of
Tawannears."
</p>

<p>
She pronounced the Seneca's name with a delicious lisp.
</p>

<p>
"Is he your lover?"
</p>

<p>
"He wants to be."  She became confidential.  "He has
been this way since he succeeded his father as Priest of Yoki
and Voice of Chua.*  He has brought rain two years
running now, and everybody says how mighty a priest and
spell-master he is.  But Wiki says I must serve him first
of all as Sacred Dancer, for Massi sent me direct to him
and not to Kokyan.  Besides, I don't like Kokyan.  He is
a good warrior and a clever priest&mdash;but I don't like him."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* The Snake.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Is Kokyan Chief Priest?"
</p>

<p>
"How ignorant you are, Englishman!  Of course not!
Wiki is chief priest&mdash;and Angwusi is priestess of Tawa,
the Sun, the Giver-of-Life.  Kokyan is only priest of Yoki.
But when a priest of Yoki is as successful as he is, he
becomes really as important as the chief priest and the
priestess.  And then Kokyan has been telling the young
men how much better things would go if he was chief priest
or had more influence in the Council."
</p>

<p>
"But what does your chief say to all this?" I questioned.
</p>

<p>
"Chief?  What chief?"
</p>

<p>
"The chief of the village!  And the war-chiefs."
</p>

<p>
She gurgled with laughter.
</p>

<p>
"You are own brother to the Awataba, Englishman!  We
do not have such chiefs.  We look down on warriors.  When
we must fight, we all do; but we make no practice of war.
The priests and the council govern the village."
</p>

<p>
"Who are the council?" I pressed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the priests&mdash;and the elders&mdash;the priests select them.
But I am tired of talking with you, Englishman.  I came
here to learn Tawannears' speech.  I told Wiki I should.
He told me I must not, and I said if I could not I should
marry Kokyan to-night.  Wiki does not want me to marry
Kokyan."
</p>

<p>
She sank down betwixt the Seneca and me, pointing a
finger at Peter.
</p>

<p>
"What is that houaw's* name?"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Bear's.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Wait, wait!" I pleaded.  "Tell me why you left us on
the ladder and went ahead into the village."
</p>

<p>
"No, I am tired of all that," she declared mutinously.
"I shall talk with Tawannears now."
</p>

<p>
"But 'tis he wishes to know," I lied.  "And he must
learn through me."
</p>

<p>
Her face brightened.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Indeed, you are stupid, Englishman!  Why did
you not say so before?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I had no chance," I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You are an Awataba," she insisted.  "You must have
killed a Spaniard, and taken his clothes.  But you asked
why Wiki called me.  It was because I talked with
Tawannears&mdash;and I am going to talk to him whenever I please.
So I just told fat old Angwusi!  Wiki said that Kokyan
would make trouble, and that I must go ahead and tell
Angwusi he was bringing you up to the village because you
had saved me and the sacred turkeys and were not
Spaniards."
</p>

<p>
"And then?" I prompted her.
</p>

<p>
"Why, then, I went to the kiva,* and Kokyan was talking
to Angwusi against Wiki, and I told him I would dance
against him if he continued to be foolish.  And he said that
Chua the Snake had counseled him that you three were to
be the doom of Homolobi and you must all be slain for a
sacrifice to Chua."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"So that was what he was talking about when Wiki

"Yes, he told the people what Chua had said, and that
you would probably bring heavy rain to spoil the harvest
or a drought next Summer.  And Chua prophesied to him
again whilst he talked, and said you came here plotting
evil, especially the red one called Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"Then I danced for Massi, and cried to all the Gods, and
as I danced they told me that Chua's voice had been
mistaken, that men who saved the Sacred Dancer and the
sacred turkeys of Massi's shrine could not be Massi's
enemies.  Kokyan said it was not true, that you were Chua's
enemies.  But I cried into the temple, and Massi answered
back that such things were best left unsaid, that they made
it seem that Chua was divided from Massi.
</p>

<p>
"Kokyan did not know what to say to that."  She
giggled reminiscently.  "So Wiki talked to Angwusi, and she
made a prayer to Tawa for light."
</p>

<p>
"What did Tawa say!" I demanded, for she had turned
again to Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"That it was too early to decide."
</p>

<p>
That, mark you, was the width of the margin betwixt
my comrades and I and death&mdash;what an old Indian woman
chose to say that the sun had told her to say!
</p>

<p>
"Is it left so?" I asked uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"How else!" she snapped pettishly.  "I did not come
here to talk to you."
</p>

<p>
"But for how long is it left so?"
</p>

<p>
"Until the festival at the end of this moon&mdash;the moon
which precedes the harvest.  But if you say any more,
Englishman, I will go to Angwusi and ask her to have Tawa
say that the others may be saved, but you must be cast
from the cliff."

CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
THE WEB OF DESTINY
</h3>

<p>
For all practical purposes we were prisoners during
the weeks we spent in Homolobi, but I cannot say
that we were fettered or chained.  The whole village,
with its rabbit-warrens of passages, its ponderous
masses of masonry, its soaring walls and towers, its rare
rock-gardens&mdash;odd patches of dirt in angles of the cliffs
around the Breast&mdash;its plazas and hidden reservoirs, we
were free to roam in.
</p>

<p>
Escorted by Kachina, we even ventured into the dim
recesses of the temple and stared at the wooden image of
Massi, a sinister object of partly human aspect presiding
over a stone tank crammed with writhing rattlesnakes,
which, our guide assured us, had not had their fangs drawn.
Yet she and all the evil priests of this forbidding place
handled the reptiles without fear, and so far as we could
see were never bitten.  Explain it how you will.
</p>

<p>
'Twas after this visit that a knife fell from the air at
Tawannears' feet, missing the opening betwixt collar-bone
and shoulder-blade by inches.  If it dropped by accident
none came to reclaim it, nor did we have sight of its owner;
and we had no choice but to suppose it had been aimed at
the Seneca's life.  But we deemed it best to hold our
tongues concerning the incident&mdash;with all save Kachina;
she had become our staunch friend and ally, more through
a whimsical interest in new faces&mdash;and especially Tawannears&mdash;as
I believe, than for aught else, unless it was the
opportunity to plague Kokyan and annoy Wiki the grave.
Later&mdash;but I gallop in advance of my story.
</p>

<p>
Kachina approved our silence.
</p>

<p>
"'Twas that ant Kokyan, beyond a doubt," she glowered.
"He shall suffer for it!  I will dance his heart out
of him, and laugh at his misery.  But it will serve no
purpose to denounce him.  He would laugh at you, and turn
people against you, saying you had come amongst us only
to create discord.  And that would be bad because it has
not rained since you came, and already people are saying
that you have brought us good luck and a fair harvest.
But you must be careful how you walk&mdash;and keep out of
dark passages."
</p>

<p>
At her suggestion we took to walking daily on the floor of
the valley where no knives could fall upon us&mdash;although
once, as Tawannears came through a copse by the river to
where she was explaining to us their irrigation system, an
arrow thrummed into a tree-trunk beside him.  He looked
unsuccessfully for the hidden archer, then ran on and
joined us; and after that we avoided copses and groves, as
well as dark corners and places commanded by overhanging
walls.  But I think the best reason why Tawannears was
not assassinated was that she stuck so close to him.
</p>

<p>
"What chance has a warrior when he has a priest for
enemy?" she said, laughing.  "'Tis well he has me to care
for him.  Do Kokyan and his tools think I would let them
slay Tawannears before I have learned this fine, booming
speech of his?"
</p>

<p>
No hindrance was placed in the way of our excursions,
but there were always men close by and&mdash;when we were
in the open&mdash;a few of the priests in serpent's-skin kilts
lurked within eye-shot.  Moreover, the smokes of the Awataba
now encircled the valley.  North, south, east and west
they rose languorously in the windless air, for the days were
still, equably warm, without great heat and wondrously dry.
</p>

<p>
Twice I asked Wiki, mainly to see what he would say, if
we might leave the valley.  Each time he smiled cryptically,
raised his arm and swept the compass of the cliffs.
</p>

<p>
"If you go, you go to death," he said the first time.
</p>

<p>
And a week later:
</p>

<p>
"Shall we send you to your deaths, Englishman?  That
would not be kind."
</p>

<p>
"But I think sometimes we linger here only to await
death," I countered.
</p>

<p>
His face was solemn, but his green eyes mocked me.
</p>

<p>
"Can you see the future?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, I am no miracle-worker."
</p>

<p>
"Then how can you know what Massi has in store for
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why do the naked bowmen lurk here so long?" I
demanded, changing the subject.
</p>

<p>
His brow wrinkled in what might have been perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"Who can say?" he answered, with a shrug.  "They are
children.  Perhaps they have killed enough meat to feed
them a while."
</p>

<p>
At times he would be more communicative, and we discussed
the beliefs of his people and their social and religious
organization.  They were in many ways the most civilized
Indians I have seen, and they seemed all the more so,
meeting them, as we did, after prolonged contact with the
depraved tribes we had encountered west of the Sky
Mountains and along the coast of the Western Ocean.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps because of the inaccessible character of their
situation, they were essentially unwarlike, wrapped up in
the pursuit of agriculture and the raising of turkeys.
Certain of these birds they bred especially for the sacred flock
attending on the shrine of Massi for the purpose of supplying
feathers, with which women wove remarkably beautiful
screens and robes.  Their crops were as good as those
obtained by European husbandmen, and much better than
those ordinarily reaped by our own farmers in America,
notwithstanding that their only tools for cultivation were
pointed sticks and the most primitive kinds of rakes and
hoes.
</p>

<p>
Wiki said, in one of his conversational moods, that their
traditions taught them that long ago this barren land of
rocks was much richer than it now was, and at that distant
time their people were very numerous in this locality.  But
in the course of ages the climate changed, and with it the
nature of the country.  The rivers dried up; the deposits
of soil were blown away; vegetation died; the sun's heat
became so fierce as to wither growing things, except in a
few favored spots.
</p>

<p>
About the same time there was a succession of eruptions
of hordes of savages from the north, low-browed, ferocious
people, akin, perhaps to the Awataba&mdash;and on the same
count to the people of Homolobi themselves.  These were
the Shunwi, or "Flesh Creatures," as they called
themselves&mdash;who overran many villages, driven mad by starvation
probably and aided by an enormous numerical superiority.
And the populations of other villages, disheartened by these
experiences, moved away into the South, where conditions
were more favorable, and gradually lost touch with those
who had remained in the home-land of the race.
</p>

<p>
The coming of the Spaniards sealed the doom of all of
them.  To Wiki, who evidently had visited the Spanish
colonies, possibly had indulged in the occasional Indian
plots to regain independence and restore the dominance of
the red race under a new Montezuma, the tragedy of his
people was very apparent.  He had seen village after village
on the outskirts of the rock desert conquered and
Christianized.  His life was dedicated to an effort to protect
Homolobi from the universal fate.  This was the reason for
his equivocal reception of our party.  It was the reason,
too, I suspect, for his uncertain attitude toward us after
he had saved our lives.  He was not sure how best to make
use of us, whether it would more aptly serve his purpose to
let us go or to sacrifice us to the superstitious wrath and
priestly politics of Kokyan's faction.
</p>

<p>
The hub of the situation, indeed, was the factional politics
that rent the village.  As Kachina had told us, the
priestly organization was likewise the political superstructure
of the social life of the community.  The council of
wise men was really a council of the priests, with a handful
of others selected by and under the control of the priests.
They not only regulated the religious life of the village,
but exerted a general supervision over its agricultural and
industrial undertakings, adjusted inter-family or clan
disputes, made and administered laws, interpreted traditions,
and in event of war furnished the military leadership that
was required.
</p>

<p>
The one-sided intellectuality which resulted was probably
the cause of the decline of the race.  This was the judgment
of Tawannears, who was best qualified to estimate their
tribal characteristics, combining in his mind, as he did, the
training and outlook of red man and white.  He took a
keen interest in the problem, despite his absorption in his
own tangled thoughts and his strange infatuation with
Kachina, which was to lead to the crisis of our affairs.
And it was largely through him and the attraction which
he possessed for the girl, with all her weird power and
influence, that we were enabled to gain a really intimate
view of the drama which was centering around our three
alien lives.
</p>

<p>
Briefly, it was the old, old story of all communities.
Wiki represented the wisdom of age.  Fifteen years
before, I gathered, he had acquired preponderating
power when he went out into the desert, as he said, "to
fast and ask a message forecasting the future," and
returned with the woman-child who grew to be Kachina, and
who, he told the village, had been sent to him by Massi
to serve the temple and dance in honor of the Ruler of the
Dead.  His own shrewd intellect combined with the Latin
grace of the girl and her original personality had
strengthened his position so that he ruled practically supreme,
being able to ignore, if he chose, the rival authority of old
Angwusi, who represented the women in the hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
It was, by the way, typical of the social organization of
Homolobi that the women had important representation in
the priesthood.  The women were in all ways equal to the
men.  They held their share of property, and they had the
right to be consulted on all matters of public import.  They
upheld and maintained the sanctity of monogamous marriage.
They had the right to secure punishment for any
man who neglected, abused or maltreated his wife.  And
while they were barred from the service of Chua and from
membership in the priestly clan or participation in the
religious dances, they had in Angwusi a representative who
ranked next to the chief priest in authority, who might, in
some cases, compel even his acquiescence on questions of
policy.
</p>

<p>
Angwusi was as clever as a priestess-stateswoman as
Wiki, but she lacked his breadth and experience.  She had
been instrumental in building up the prestige of Kokyan,
the young priest of Yoki and suitor for Kachina's hand;
but as soon as he was strong enough to make himself felt in
opposition to the chief priest, she had hastened to redress
the balance, hoping, in the conflicting ambitions of the two
men, to find the means for gaining her own ends, whatever
they were.
</p>

<p>
But the situation was complicated again by the interposition
of Kachina.  She had not, until recently, been regarded
as more than an assistant and subordinate of Wiki.
Kokyan's courtship and rivalry of the chief priest and the
politics precipitated by his rise, however, had lifted her to
an importance equal with that enjoyed by the other three;
and she was not slow to take advantage of it.  How loyal
she was to Wiki, of course, I cannot say; but from my
knowledge of her afterward I should say that she would
have stood by him, after securing such concessions as she
wanted for herself, had it not been for the arrival of
Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
Love and hate, the lure of beauty, hunger for power,
these were the factors here as elsewhere.  Suppose we had
gone north, instead of south, to pass the Salt Lake, suppose
we had not ventured into these mountains!  What would
have happened then to the fortunes of Wiki, of Kachina,
of Kokyan and Angwusi and the people of Homolobi&mdash;ay,
and of Tawannears, Peter and myself.  Fifteen hundred
lives would have ended differently&mdash;I say nothing of the
Awataba, who perished for causes beyond their comprehension.
</p>

<p>
So slender is the thread of destiny which weaves our lives!
</p>

<p>
But my speculation, after all, is purposeless.  We were
fated to do what we did.  It was written in the Book that
we should go to Homolobi, just as it was written that
Tawannears' fantastic search should be carried to its logical
conclusion.  How else can you explain the instant attraction
he had for the girl, the light that shone in his eyes when
he first fronted her threatening arrow, the very ease with
which they two brushed aside from their path the needs and
wants and desires and wishes of fifteen hundred others?
It was written that it should be so.  Why, even Peter's giant
strength had its rôle to play in this, as in other acts, of the
drama we lived.  And I&mdash;am I not the narrator?
</p>

<p>
So I say there was no accident in what transpired.  Accident
must have slain us heedlessly a score of times before
Destiny was ready for us to work the deeds it had prepared
for us.
</p>

<p>
If Wiki, priest of Massi, from whatever abode he occupies,
looks over my shoulder as I write I know that he will smile
assent.  There are some forces beyond human control.  We
were caught fast in the grip of such a force when the
people of Homolobi gathered before the kiva of Massi for
the pre-harvest festival at the end of that moon in which
we had come into their valley&mdash;I cannot make the date
more specific, for we had lost all track of time in more than
two years of wandering.
</p>

<p>
It was a clear, cloudless day, still not too hot, with almost
no breeze stirring, exactly like all the other days since our
arrival; and I remember the people squatting around the
open space in front of the temple made room for us readily
in the front row, some of them actually smiling, so popular
had we become on account of the good weather we had
brought the village.
</p>

<p>
Weather was everything to these people.  In fear of a
failed harvest they always kept a year's store of dried
crops ahead; but there had been times when the crops had
failed two years running, and they regulated their whole
lives to the one end of securing enough food.  Religion,
with them, was weather.  Hence the popularity of Kokyan,
Priest of Yoki, who had twice secured them abundant early
Summer rain.  Hence, too,&mdash;and most paradoxically&mdash;our
own popularity, because we had staved off the unseasonably
heavy storms which sometimes destroyed or diminished a
good planting.
</p>

<p>
Observe the irony.  We had made headway against Kokyan's
enmity by virtue of the very talent he arrogated to
himself.  Hence the frowns he bent on us as he danced from
the temple, leading his snake priests, every man a center
of twisting coils of slimy reptiles.
</p>

<p>
This was the opening phase of the ceremonies.  Wiki
and Angwusi sat in front of the temple entrance upon solid
blocks of wood, behind them leering the horrid features of
Massi, carried forward from his darksome shrine into the
glare of daylight for this occasion.  Kachina had not yet
appeared, but grouped in a semicircle in back of idol,
priest and priestess were the masked dancers of the different
clans, arrayed in the semblance of bird, beast, reptile,
vegetable or insect.
</p>

<p>
Overhead towered the bulging brow of the cliff.  Across
the housetops reared the distant wall of the valley, crowned
by the slim smokes of the Awataba, those persistent
savages who belied their inconsequential natures by the
fixity of the purpose with which they hemmed us in.  And
all around the plaza, and on the nearby house-roofs, too,
were crowded the village people, the men in their white
kilts&mdash;the red border being reserved for the highest members
of the priesthood and the Wise Men of the Council; the
women in plain white robes that folded over the right
shoulder and slid under the left breast, curving graciously
to the figure and banded tight around the waist.
</p>

<p>
Drums thudded inside the temple to herald the approach
of Kokyan and his loathsome attendants.  They pranced
slowly into the light, snakes twining about their middles,
their arms and their necks, forked tongues darting and
hissing&mdash;and never a man bitten!
</p>

<p>
The snake priests sounded a low chant, as they advanced
with a jerking, undulating step, apparently designed to
reproduce the traveling motion of a snake.  Whining in a
minor key, the chant progressed in volume, the rumble of
the unseen drums rising in tune with it.
</p>

<p>
Bound the open space danced the ugly procession, the
people instinctively drawing back as the snake-ridden men
came near.  Kokyan, the scowl of a fiend on his face, passed
us and went on.  The whole line passed, and I breathed
freely again, for I did not like those scores of unrestrained
reptiles, any one of which in threshing free of its bearer
might carry death into the throng.
</p>

<p>
The drums thudded louder and louder as the priests
circled the plaza the second time; and the snakes were more
excited than ever by the noise, the unaccustomed sunlight
and the white-garbed rows of onlookers.  They writhed up
above the heads of the priests, struck at each other and
hissed into the empty air.  'Twas a nightmare spectacle&mdash;such
a picture as the Italian Dante dreamed of the torments
of Hell.  But again Kokyan passed, and again I felt the
breath whistle from my lungs.  Then it came&mdash;what I had
been expecting!
</p>

<p>
The drumming became hurried, confused, and the priests
jostled together, as if surprised.  There was a <i>plop!</i> on
the sandy ground, and a rattlesnake as long as Peter
contorted into its fighting coils within arm's-reach of
Tawannears.  But the Seneca remained perfectly quiet, not
moving a muscle of face or body.  A gasp went up from
the people around us.  Women cried out, and children
whimpered.  Wiki rose from his stool with a single curt
order, and one of the priests stepped out of the line and
retrieved the snake, calming it by a stroking motion down
its belly as he grasped it just under the venomous head.
</p>

<p>
It all happened so quickly that few saw the incident, but
Peter's big hand gripped my arm until I thought he would
tear it off.
</p>

<p>
"If he mofed he was deadt!" he gasped in my ear.  "<i>Ja</i>,
if he mofed, Tawannears was deadt!"
</p>

<p>
"Did he drop it?" I whispered fiercely to Tawannears.
"Did you see the priest drop it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, brother," he answered coolly, "but who could
swear he was responsible?"
</p>

<p>
"And you stayed quiet!" I marveled.  "How could you
know the snake would not strike?"
</p>

<p>
"It was nothing," he returned.  "That snake never
strikes unless it thinks you are frightened of it.  The man
bungled.  He should have dropped it on Tawannears.  Then
it would have struck instinctively.  But Hawenneyu did
not will it so.  Tawannears' medicine is too strong for the
snake-priest, Kokyan."

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
TAWANNEARS' SEARCH IS ENDED
</h3>

<p>
The last of the snake priests disappeared through
the temple entrance, and old Angwusi left her stool
and advanced in front of Massi's image, prostrated
her bulky figure with much difficulty and then made
invocation to the sun, riding high toward mid-afternoon.  Her
words had the form of a prayer, but at intervals responses
were intoned by the masked clan dancers behind her, and
at the end all the people shouted an answer, turning their
faces up to the sky.
</p>

<p>
She returned to her seat amidst a rapt silence that was
broken only when Wiki made a signal with his "paho," or
prayer-stick, a painted and befeathered baton, which was
the symbol of his office.  As he raised it the drums in the
temple rumbled again, and the masked dancers began to
sing, swaying their bodies to the haunting rhythm of the
music.  After each stanza Wiki would chant an invocation
of his own, prostrating himself on the sand before Massi.
And this song terminated, as had Angwusi's prayer, in a
chorus of all the people, the thudding of the drums running
in and out of the roar of voices that echoed against the
overhanging cliff.
</p>

<p>
The singing died away.  Silence once more.  Wiki, standing
now beside the image of the Ruler of the Dead, lifted
his paho in a second gesture of command.  Tap-tap-tap! very
slow, went the drums.  The masked clan dancers sorted
themselves into two files facing inward on either side of the
temple doorway.  The people around us, whose interest in
the ceremonies had been perfunctory since the snake dance,
bunched forward in attitudes of pleasurable expectancy.
A murmur of voices bandied back and forth the one
word&mdash;"Kachina!"
</p>

<p>
I saw the muscles twisting on Tawannears' jaw.  His
face, that was usually so masklike, was openly expressive.
But a look of puzzled inquiry in his eyes changed to
bewilderment, when, instead of the Sacred Dancer, appeared the
snake priests, marshaled by Kokyan and staggering under
the weight of a hurdle upon which reposed a mighty pumpkin.
It was twice as thick as Peter in girth and half as tall
from the litter of stalks and vine-leaves upon which it
was set.
</p>

<p>
The drums throbbed slowly, and to the cadence of their
beat the masked dancers struck up a new song, a wailing,
minor melody, beseeching, imploring of Massi the continued
toleration of their wants.  The snake priests and their
burden passed between the two lines from the temple doorway
to the image of the Ruler of the Dead, halted a moment
facing it, turned, and then, with Wiki and Angwusi preceding
Kokyan, and the column of masked dancers following
the hurdle-bearers, solemnly paraded the circuit of the
plaza; whilst all the people sitting or crouching on the
ground bent their heads and muttered, "Kachina!" or
"The Sacred Dancer comes!" or else addressed impromptu
personal prayers to Massi, Yoki, Chua and other lesser
divinities.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears' excitement had grown to an extraordinary
degree.  The breath whistled in his nostrils.  His chest rose
and fell as though he were running.  His features were
drawn and haggard.  His eyes never swerved from the
enormous pumpkin.
</p>

<p>
"How could they have nourished it to such a size!" I
whispered.
</p>

<p>
He did not hear me, but Peter, on my other side, made
shrill reply&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Idt is not real."
</p>

<p>
"Not real?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>, you vatch."
</p>

<p>
I peered at it the more closely, myself.  Certes, it had
all the outward seeming of a pumpkin magnified a score
of times.  There were the corrugations of the surface, the
mottled yellow color with a hint of pale green, the blunt-ended
stalk.  But whilst I watched, the snake priests completed
the plaza's circuit, gently deposited the hurdle in
front of Massi, and took their position behind the idol in a
single rank, with Kokyan a step in advance, arms folded on
their breasts.  The masked dancers formed a ring around
the image, the giant pumpkin and the group of priests; and
Wiki and Angwusi, on either side of the hurdle, commenced
the next phase of the elaborate ritual.
</p>

<p>
Wiki seemed to be delivering an oration to the god.  He
included by his gestures the people in the plaza, the village,
the priests, the valley below the cliff, and finally the
pumpkin.  Afterward we learned that he had been summing up
the tribe's case for divine assistance, speaking from the
viewpoint of the men.  Angwusi, who followed him, described
for the benefit of the deity the efforts put forward
by the women and the especial reasons they thought they
had for meriting aid.  And to cap it, both of them united
in an address drawing to Massi's notice the magnificent
pumpkin which they would sacrifice to him.
</p>

<p>
This brought from the ring of dancers a prolonged
shout of applause, the drums in the temple pulsed into a
jerky, varying beat, and the masked figures pranced crazily
around the idol and the pumpkin, the priests singing
another of their weird, hesitating songs.  Faster and faster
thumped the drums.  Swifter and swifter whirled the
dancers.  Wilder and wilder waxed the song.  The end came
in a crescendo of noise, color and movement.  It snapped
off almost with a physical jar.  Priests and dancers flung
themselves upon their faces in the send.  The drums were
stilled.  The quiet was so intense that all about me I could
hear people's breathing, the gusty pants of Tawannears as
loud as musketry by contrast.
</p>

<p>
For a dozen breaths this quiet reigned.  Then Wiki rose,
bowed low to that monstrous idol and stepped to the vast
yellow pumpkin, sitting serenely upon its hurdle.  He
extended his paho before Massi's unseeing eyes, recited
briefly a prayer&mdash;and rapped the pumpkin once.  A sigh
of anticipation burst from the audience.  The pumpkin fell
apart, dividing cleanly in quarters, and from its hollow
shell stepped Kachina, a lithe bronze statue came to life,
clad from breast to thighs in a sheath of turkey-feathers
that puffed out under her arms in a mockery of wings.  Her
blue-black hair floated free beneath the confining band of
serpent's-skin around her brow.
</p>

<p>
For an instant she poised in the fallen shell of the pumpkin,
arms spread as though for flight.  Then she leaped&mdash;almost,
it seemed, she flew&mdash;from the hurdle to the sand,
swooped this way and that, always with the gliding, wavy
motion of a bird on the wing, hovered before Wiki, before
Angwusi, sank in a pretty pose of piety before Massi's
warped face, and so sped into the measures of a dance that
was all grace and fire and vivid emotion, a dance no Indian
could have done, and which charmed her beholders by its
very exotic spell, its fierce bursts of passion, demonstrative,
seductive.
</p>

<p>
Kokyan made no secret of its effect upon him.  The
gloomy face of the young priest was lit by the unholy fires
that burned within him.  He came from his place at the
head of the snake priests and stood with Wiki and Angwusi
by the wooden idol, his eyes drinking in the sinuous
loveliness of the dancer, her slender, naked feet scarcely
touching the sand as she leaped and postured from mood to
mood, her own eyes flaring through the tossing net of her
hair, her lips pouting, smiling, luring, challenging,
repulsing.
</p>

<p>
But I had little chance to observe her influence upon the
Priest of Yoki.  Beside me Tawannears was risen to his
knees and in his face was the look of the damned man who
sees heaven's gates opening for him, doubting, trusting,
unbelieving, paralyzed by joy, scorched by fear.  He started
to clamber to his feet and the people in back of us volleyed
low protests.  I seized his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Sit," I adjured him.  "What ails you, man?"
</p>

<p>
I think he did not even hear me.
</p>

<p>
"Use your wits," I exclaimed irritably.  "You will have
us all slain.  You can see the maid anon."
</p>

<p>
'Twas Peter gave me the key to his state.
</p>

<p>
"He t'inks she is Gahano," he muttered.  "<i>Ja</i>, dot's idt."
</p>

<p>
I exerted all my strength, and dragged the Seneca back
to his haunches.
</p>

<p>
"Will you ruin us, brother?" I rasped.  "This is sacred
in the eyes of these people.  We are&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
For the first time he seemed to comprehend what I was
trying to do.
</p>

<p>
"Otetiani does not know," he said mildly.  "She is
my Lost Soul."
</p>

<p>
"A mist has clouded Tawannears' eyes," I answered,
realizing that in this humor I must abide by the imagery of
his people.
</p>

<p>
"No, brother," he returned, still without feeling.  "You
have not seen.  You have forgotten.  But Tawannears
knew&mdash;before this happened there was a song in his heart that
told him this would be."
</p>

<p>
"Of what?" I begged, conscious of the hostile looks that
were acknowledging this interruption of the scene.  "What
said this song?  Was it of one maid who looked like
another?"
</p>

<p>
"She does not look like another," he said with dignity.
"She is another.  She is my Lost Soul."
</p>

<p>
"You are mad, brother," I groaned.
</p>

<p>
He smiled pityingly at me.
</p>

<p>
"No, my eyes are opened.  But Otetiani cannot see.
What said the ancient tale of my people?  That the warrior
who traveled beyond the sunset would find the land of
Lost Souls&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is this land beyond the sunset?" I inquired sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
"It must be!"  His voice rang with conviction.  "Did
we not see the sun set behind the Sky Mountains?  And we
crossed the Sky Mountains&mdash;and this land must be still
beyond the Sky Mountains."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, but Tawannears, you know that this is but a
tale&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a tale of my people," he agreed steadily.  "If one
warrior did it, why could not Tawannears?  So I believed
always.  Now I know it to be so.  I have done it.  Here
we sit in the valley of Lost Souls.  There is Ataentsic,
brother."
</p>

<p>
He pointed to fat old Angwusi, who was eying us as
balefully as Kokyan and the snake priests, at last oblivious
to the untiring grace with which Kachina still danced before
Massi's wooden grimace.
</p>

<p>
"And there is Jouskeha, her grandson."  He singled out
Wiki.  "As the tale told, when the warrior came to the
valley his Lost Soul was dancing with other souls before
those two, and Jouskeha, in pity for him, took his Lost Soul
and placed her in a pumpkin, and he carried the pumpkin
back to his own country.
</p>

<p>
"See it is all here.  There is the pumpkin.  There are
the Lost Souls, who also danced.  Ataentsic, I think, is
loath to give up my Lost Soul, but Jouskeha's face is only
sad.  It is all as the tale said it would be.  All that remains,
brother, is to replace the Lost Soul in the pumpkin, and
carry her back to my village."
</p>

<p>
Argument with him was impossible.  He believed implicitly
in this chain of inexplicable coincidences.  He, who
was in so many ways as cultured as an English gentleman,
was the complete savage in this matter, resting his
confidence in the vague mythology of his people, accepting for
truth a familiar likeness and a sequence of parallel
incidents.
</p>

<p>
I turned to Peter with a gesture of despair.
</p>

<p>
"What can we do?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," replied the Dutchman phlegmatically.
</p>

<p>
Whilst my back was toward him for this fleeting
exchange of words, the Seneca wrenched loose from
my grasp and strode out into the center of the
plaza toward the group of priests and masked dancers
surrounding Kachina's whirling form.  The ceremony was
suspended, stopped, as if the atrocious image of Massi had
issued a direct vocal fiat.  A growl of resentment came
from the watchers on our side of the plaza.  The faces of
the snake priests were murderous.  The leaping hate of the
masked dancers was reflected in pose and denunciations.
Angwusi frowned; Kokyan grinned with diabolical satisfaction.
Kachina showed surprise and a certain distaste.
Wiki alone concealed his feelings.
</p>

<p>
For us there was left no other course save audacity.
We were committed.  The conduct of Tawannears was such
as to stir the anger of any barbarous people.  Excuses were
impossible.  Our one chance was to carry it off boldly.
And that meant we must make the first attack.  'Twas for
us to take and keep the offensive.
</p>

<p>
"Come," I said to Peter.
</p>

<p>
He reared himself erect and lumbered beside me.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," he squeaked through his nose, "we hafe a &mdash;&mdash;
of a time."
</p>

<p>
I caught up with Tawannears, and resumed my grip
on his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Keep quiet.  'Tis for me to do the talking."
</p>

<p>
He made no answer, offered no opposition.  I do not
believe he had had any plan in rising when he did.  He
simply obeyed the urge in his heart to possess himself at
once of this girl, whom he supposed to be the incarnation of
his lost love, which had torn him free of all restraints,
impelled him forward calmly to claim what he considered
nobody would dare to deny him.  But he had no means
of speaking intelligibly to anyone within the priests' circle,
unless it was to Kachina herself.  And whether he had
thought of this or not, he obeyed me now as docilely as a
child.
</p>

<p>
"Do as I do," I muttered to my comrades, as we passed
the circle of the masked dancers.
</p>

<p>
And opposite Massi's image I paused and offered a low
bow.  Tawannears and Peter imitated me faithfully; and
that served to stall off the first wave of indignation.  The
priests were nonplussed.  We had accepted their deity,
rendered him adequate honor.  I drove home the advantage
whilst I held it.
</p>

<p>
"We are strangers in your midst," I said to Wiki,
speaking in Spanish.  "It may be we have offended against
your customs, but let our excuse be that my red brother
thinks he has just seen a mighty piece of magic
performed."
</p>

<p>
This whetted their appetites and equally placated their
wrath.  Wiki was naturally pleased with the idea of having
an outsider testify to the closeness of his relations with
his deity.  He and Kachina, who had danced to his side,
translated rapidly the gist of what I had said.  Kokyan
and his serpent priests scowled blackly.  Old Angwusi
looked interested.  The others were baffled.  But whatever
they secretly felt they were induced to lay aside their
hostility long enough to listen to my story, and that was
everything, because it provided the opportunity for driving in
tighter than ever the political wedges which disrupted the
priesthood.
</p>

<p>
The effect of my narrative upon Kachina was comic.
She swelled with pride, repeating with gusto Tawannears'
claim that he had known her in a previous existence, and
thus arrogating to herself an undeniably superior position.
Wiki was equally strengthened by the tale, as bearing out
his original announcement of Kachina's divine origin, but
perplexed by the possible contingencies in Tawannears'
appearance.
</p>

<p>
Angwusi was flatly disdainful of the whole affair.  It
helped her in nowise, except that she was identified with
a goddess of a strange tribe.  And against this she arrayed
the probable enhancement of Kachina's position, and the
certainty of increased prestige for Wiki.
</p>

<p>
But the one who foamed at the mouth at my amazing
tale was Kokyan.  The Priest of Yoki literally stamped and
chewed his lips with rage.  His hot eyes flickered.  The
sweat beaded his forehead as he fought for self-control.
Again and again he ripped out savage objections or mocking
comments.  He saw in acceptance of our story double
defeat for himself; Wiki's leadership impregnably fortified
and another bar thrown betwixt himself and Kachina.
</p>

<p>
"The red stranger lies," he stormed&mdash;Wiki translating
his criticisms with gleeful assistance from Kachina, who
delighted in being at the center of the debate.  "If Kachina
was of his people, why can she not talk to him in his
tongue?"
</p>

<p>
"The Great Spirit took the knowledge from her&mdash;for
reasons of his own," answered Tawannears, and I
translated.
</p>

<p>
"I can talk in Tawannears' tongue," snapped Kachina.
"It comes to me easily."  She cast a sly glance at the
Seneca.  "I am sure I must have known it once."
</p>

<p>
"It is a lie," howled Kokyan.  "Has he not said that
this Lost Soul of his was a maid full-grown when she died?
And do we not know that Kachina was a child with new
teeth when Wiki brought her to Homolobi?"
</p>

<p>
"The Great Spirit's ways are not our ways," returned
Tawannears steadily.  "He may change the maid's years,
but he cannot change her face or the Soul that was lost.
What are years to Him?"
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" snarled Kokyan.  "Will wise men believe such
tales?  Is it likely the Ruler of Death or any other god
would allow such wanderers as these to have knowledge
of the Heaven-sent?"
</p>

<p>
Wiki, who had said little after his habit, contenting
himself with translating the arguments back and forth,
and now and then checking Kachina when she developed
a tendency to embroil still further the irate Kokyan, now
pursed his lips and sought for safe middle-ground.
</p>

<p>
"Here is no question to be judged with heat," he
declared.  "There is much that is strange in what these
strangers say.  Yet how can priests, who live their lives
with what is unreal, be unwilling to believe a tale because
it denies what seems truth?  It does seem strange to me
that Massi, whose servant I am, has never been disposed to
acquaint me with what the strangers have said, although
often, as you know, he has come to me and made clear
the future&mdash;to the great good of the village."
</p>

<p>
At this there were cries of:
</p>

<p>
"Great is Wiki!"
</p>

<p>
"Favored above other priests is Wiki!"
</p>

<p>
"The Chief Priest speaks wisdom!"
</p>

<p>
"But who am I," continued Wiki, "to expect that Massi
will tell me all?  No, if he did so, then would I be as great
as he, and a god.  Perhaps Massi sent these strangers here
to tell me this message, instead of summoning me into the
desert to fast until wisdom came to me.  I do not know.
But I do know that the strangers have told us a marvelous
tale.  If it is true, then, indeed, are we favored of Massi,
and Kachina, the Sacred Dancer, is twice holy.  If it is
not&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"How can it be true!" insisted Kokyan boldly.  "Chua
the Snake, as all know, has taken Homolobi under his
protection.  Have not I had his confidence for two years past?
Has he not told me things which Massi, busy ruling the
villages of the dead, has forgotten?  Is it likely that Chua
would forbear to tell me of so wondrous an occurrence?"
</p>

<p>
"Chua has told you some things that did not come to
pass," flashed Kachina.  "You told us he said these
strangers would bring bad-luck, and they brought good-luck."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that is in their favor," interposed Wiki.
</p>

<p>
"There has been bickering about them since they set
foot in the valley," Angwusi thrust in spitefully.
</p>

<p>
"There was bickering before," said Wiki sternly.
"Enough has been said.  We will examine the matter
with care.  I am Massi's priest, and I serve him in this.
Let all&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was interrupted by shouts of alarm on the outskirts
of the throng of village people who had clustered thickly
about the group of priests, edging closer and closer as the
discussion became more animated.  We all turned in the
direction of the disturbance.  A lane was being formed
through the crowd.  Villagers with bows and arrows were
forcing back the bystanders to make room for a little knot
of squat, naked, brown-skinned men, who walked between
the jostling walls with wary glances and startled leaps to
avoid contact with those not of their kind.
</p>

<p>
A murmur rose&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The Awataba!"
</p>

<p>
People gave ground more readily when they saw that
the newcomers were the bowmen of the rock desert, men
a degree or two above the level of the beasts, their bodies
crusted with filth, their hair matted, their weapons crudely
formed, their bellies protuberant from eating dirt when
other food failed, their eyes dully stupid, but alive with
animal dread of the unknown.  These came forward until
they reached the open circle in front of Massi's image,
and at first sight of that dread countenance they cast
themselves flat upon the ground and wriggled on until their
leader was able to put his hand upon Wiki's foot.
</p>

<p>
The villagers who had attended them made brief report,
and Kachina started, bending forward betwixt Tawannears
and me, her lips close to my ear.
</p>

<p>
"This is bad," she whispered.  "The field guards say
the Awataba have left the cliffs and descended into the
valley.  They are come to ask Wiki to give you up to
them.  They&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But now the Awataba were talking for themselves in
awkward guttural clicks and clucking noises, peeping at
us from under beetling brows and hanging mats of muddy
hair, prostrating themselves anew at a wrinkle showing
in Wiki's face; but withal, demonstrating a dumb
persistency, a blunt determination, that reminded me of the
smoke that swirled daily above the valley cliffs.
</p>

<p>
Kachina gasped.
</p>

<p>
"They are asking for you," she interpreted.  "They
say they have dreamed that if they sacrifice you three their
wanderings will come to an end and they will always have
food."
</p>

<p>
Wiki checked her with an order which sent the snake
priests to close around us.  They herded us out of the
crowd and up to the temple roof, making signs that we
were to enter the room assigned to us.  In there we could
neither see nor hear anything of what went on, and leaving
one man to watch us from the terrace, they hastened back
to take their share in the decision of our fate.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
PETER'S BOULDER
</h3>

<p>
There was no twilight in Homolobi.  Buried beneath
the jutting overhang of the Western cliff,
the village was plunged in darkness the moment the
sun had sunk behind it.  One minute I looked through
the narrow doorway of our room and saw the gaunt figure
of the serpent priest, our sentinel, limned against the gray
house-walls across the temple plaza.  Then the enveloping
gloom had swallowed him.  Only upon the distant Eastern
cliffs of the valley a few crimson beams clashed harshly
upon the painted rock strata, flickered courageously&mdash;and
vanished, too.
</p>

<p>
But immediately other lights flared up.  The plaza,
whence rose&mdash;had risen this hour&mdash;a continuous hum and
buzz of comment, of a sudden glared with torches.  More
torches shone on the opposite house-roofs, and from the
unseen depths of the valley at the foot of the Breast
blossomed a great flower of light that grew and grew,
accompanied by a muted roar of savage voices, dissonant,
unrestrained.
</p>

<p>
The voices of Homolobi were stilled&mdash;as though Wild
had suppressed all with one wave of his feathered paho.
The village became wrapped in the silence of death.  And
now our ears could hear distinctly that gritting insanity of
frenzied noise, rising and falling with the leaping of the
flames that streaked hundreds of feet into the air to
illumine the darkness beyond the village walls.  They were
faint, far away, but the savage insistency of their chorus
was unescapable, even when the hum of the village began
knew.
</p>

<p>
"The Awataba," I muttered, more to myself than to the
others.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," assented Corlaer.  "Der bowmen are madt.  Dey
go crazy, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Tawannears said nothing.  He had not spoken in the hour
which had elapsed since the serpent priests had driven us
from the plaza.  Until the light failed I had been able
to see him sitting motionless, with his back to the wall, his
eyes staring into vacancy.  Now, I suppose, he occupied
the same position.  At any rate, I could not see him.
</p>

<p>
"If we had but a pound of powder and ball between us,"
I groaned.
</p>

<p>
"What use?" replied Corlaer.  "If you kill all der
people in Homolobi we hafe still der Awataba."
</p>

<p>
"No use," I admitted.  "Yet I like not the thought of
dying in a trap."
</p>

<p>
"We will not be deadt alone," the Dutchman grunted.  "<i>Ha!</i>"
</p>

<p>
His exclamation was caused by the soft tread of a foot
in the doorway.  I jumped to one side, drawing the knife
and tomahawk from my belt.
</p>

<p>
"Into the open!" I whispered.
</p>

<p>
But Kachina's voice answered me, the sibilant Spanish
just loud enough to reach my ear.
</p>

<p>
"Quiet!  'Tis I."
</p>

<p>
I extended my arm and clutched her feather garment.
</p>

<p>
"Alone?" I whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Let me in.  I&mdash;  Where is Tawannears?"
</p>

<p>
The Seneca's voice came from the darkness at my elbow.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears is here, Gahano."
</p>

<p>
The throb of gladness in it sent my heart leaping into
my throat.  There were tears in my eyes.
</p>

<p>
She understood him.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him," she ordered me, with a tinkle of musical
laughter, "my name is Kachina."
</p>

<p>
"She is Gahano to me," was Tawannears' answer.
</p>

<p>
I felt her press by me, and a moment later her voice
reached me again, strangely muffled.
</p>

<p>
"What I am called matters little," she said.  "I think
Wiki lies when he says I came from Massi.  I seem to
remember a time many years ago when I often saw people
who were white like you.  But that does not matter.
Tawannears is a man!  And I am tired of priests and their
ways.  Ay, a man who would travel as far as Tawannears
for a woman is a man!"
</p>

<p>
"We shall all of us go soon upon a longer journey,"
I returned significantly.  "And you, too, if you stay here."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she agreed, her voice still muffled.
</p>

<p>
I thrust out my hand and found her body in Tawannears'
arms.
</p>

<p>
"What!" I gasped in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears laughed softly&mdash;and at that note, contented,
caressing, Peter, also, indulged in a peal of low laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Dot's funny," he squeaked.  "We come all dis way,
andt Tawannears gets her, andt we die quick."
</p>

<p>
"What did the fat one say?" inquired Kachina, wrenching
herself from the Seneca's embrace.
</p>

<p>
I told her.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said a second time.  "Death is coming.  That
is why I am here.  The Awataba told the council they must
have you to sacrifice.  They said they dreamed that your
lives would appease their gods, but I think that ant Kokyan
planted the idea in their heads.  I would have said so, but
Wiki would not let me, and so I ran away."
</p>

<p>
"What will the council do?" I asked helplessly.
</p>

<p>
The hum of the village and the blurred voices of the
bowmen at the foot of the Breast rasped through the
night.
</p>

<p>
"They will give you up.  Kokyan said there should be
no argument.  It was sufficient sign of your harmfulness
that the Awataba were so emboldened.  And when Wiki
argued against it, the Bowmen said they would lay waste
the valley, even though they all perished for it.  Then
Angwusi joined with Kokyan, and I spoke as I said."
</p>

<p>
"Hark!" said Peter.
</p>

<p>
From the plaza came a bellow of voices.
</p>

<p>
"The council is ended," exclaimed Kachina.  "They are
coming."
</p>

<p>
"A few of them will die," I answered grimly.  "You had
best go."
</p>

<p>
"Old fool!" she retorted contemptuously.  "You have no
wits.  They will block up the doorway, and break in upon
you from above.  You have no chance here."
</p>

<p>
"Then we will go out into the open."
</p>

<p>
"No, you shall come with me.  I know a way.  It is
dangerous in daylight, and perhaps we shall all perish; but
if we gain the cliff-top we can hold our own.  Come!  I
will lead Tawannears, and do you others follow him."
</p>

<p>
We moved softly out the door, and she guided us along
the wall of the temple's upper story.  Here was black night,
unmitigated, for the overhang of the cliff shut out even
the star-shine.  We had passed two other doorways, as I
could tell by feeling with my hands, the uproar in the
plaza becoming deafening in the meantime when there was
a patter of feet and torches blazed across the terrace.  Men
streamed by us, indistinct running figures, and we flattened
against the wall, trusting to the shifting shadows to conceal
us; but a group of a dozen or more with torches made the
night brilliant as day.
</p>

<p>
A yell announced our discovery.  There was a rush that
we stemmed with ready steel, and Kachina cried:
</p>

<p>
"Run!  Do not stay to fight!"
</p>

<p>
We won a brief respite by our efforts; and she dived
into a nearby doorway, and we found ourselves tumbling
down a steep stair that twisted on itself and debouched
into a vast chamber which we recognized as the temple.
Already men were pouring in from the plaza, Kokyan at
their head, a torch waving in one hand, a knife in the other.
And behind us the restricted stair echoed the shouts of
our immediate pursuers.
</p>

<p>
Kachina ignored Kokyan, and guided us past the tank
before the empty altar of Massi, in which writhed the
reptile guardians of the shrine; but Kokyan sped around the
other, and shorter, side of the temple.  The foam was
dripping from his jaws; his eyeballs were staring from their
sockets.  And as he saw Kachina turn toward a doorway
that showed dimly behind the altar he shrieked with fury
and hurled his torch at her.  It would have struck her
had not Tawannears reached out and caught it as expertly
as he was used to catching the tomahawks thrown at him
in practice by his warriors.
</p>

<p>
An instant Tawannears held the flaming club of resinous
pine-wood.  Then he sounded the war-whoop of the Iroquois
that is dreaded by white man and red from the Great
Lakes to the Ohio, and sprang forward to meet the Priest of
Yoki.  They came together beside the tank of snakes, but
Tawannears refused to close, backing away in such fashion
that the priest was poised on the very verge of the tank,
from which arose an evil tumult of hissing as the snakes
responded to the confusion above them.
</p>

<p>
Pursuit and flight were stayed for the instant by the
spectacle of this struggle.  Moreover, Peter and I guarded
the space betwixt the opposite side of the tank and the
temple wall, and no man, not even the snake priests
themselves, cared to try to leap that gap.  Kachina, smiling
unconcernedly, her feather raiment rising and falling steadily
with her even breathing, stood, with hands on her hips, in
the doorway behind the tank, watching the contest of the
two men for her.  If she had any feeling of concern she
covered it effectually.
</p>

<p>
Kokyan howled a curse at the Seneca.  Tawannears replied
with a smile as unconcerned as the girl's and the
priest stabbed at him desperately, with all the strength
of his body behind the blow.  Never moving his feet,
Tawannears swayed his shoulders to avoid the knife, and
struck sideways with the torch he held in his left hand.
It smote the priest on the thigh as he was off-balance, and
Kokyan tottered and fell&mdash;into the squirming midst of the
tank of snakes.  Tawannears, without a word, tossed the
torch after him, and a bedlam of angry hisses responded.
Looking over my shoulder, I shuddered at what I saw.
</p>

<p>
The Priest of Yoki was submerged beneath a tempest of
coiling monsters tortured by the flames of the torch and
excited by the unusual light and noise.  I had a vision of
triangular heads that darted back and forth, of fangs that
dribbled venom, of slimy, twisting lengths that coiled and
uncoiled and coiled again&mdash;and under them all a shape that
quivered and jerked and called feebly and was still.
</p>

<p>
I turned and ran, Peter at my heels.  The Dutchman's
flat, impassive face was a study in horror.  Myself, I
experienced a nausea that left me weak as I staggered
behind Tawannears into the doorway before which ordinarily
stood the idol of Massi.  Kachina's figure flitted ahead of
us, unseen, but notified to our senses by the echo of her
feet and low-voiced directions as we came to turns or
steps up and down in the course of the passage.  And
close after us sounded the hue and cry of the pursuit, a
confused clamoring of people driven mad with hate.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, 'twas the stimulus of their hatred flogged me
back to self-control.  At a corner in the passage, with a
glimmer of light beyond advertising its emergence upon
some opening, I gripped Peter and bade him stop.
</p>

<p>
"We must fight them back," I panted.  "They do not
expect&mdash;we shall gain time."
</p>

<p>
He crouched next me, our bodies blocking the way, and
the leaders of the pursuers, rounding the turn at a run,
crashed full upon our knives.  We flung the two corpses
into the mob that pelted after them, slashing and hacking
with knives and hatchets in the half-light of the torches,
until we had reared a barricade that gave us an opportunity
to resume our flight with a trifling lead&mdash;for men
hesitated to cross the battered heap we had left behind us.
Yet we were no more than a dozen paces in the lead when
we broke from the passage into a courtyard deep in the
cleft of the cliff.  In front and overhead towered the
peculiar bulging rock formation which protected Homolobi
from assault from above.  The cliff-top mushroomed out so
that it overhung the Breast, and leaning against its base
was a double ladder from which Kachina and Tawannears
waved us on.
</p>

<p>
I could not see what use it was to climb to some rock-lodge
where we would be picked off in daylight by archers
on the temple roof, but there was no time for argument
with that yelping horde on our track.  Peter and I raced
across the court, and rattled up the hidebound rungs as
fast as we could go.  There were men on the lower rungs
already when we stepped upon a narrow shelf where the
girl and Tawannears awaited us.
</p>

<p>
"Come," she said nervously in Spanish, and plucked the
Seneca by the hand.
</p>

<p>
"Waidt," shrilled Peter solemnly, and he seized the
ladder-ends in his huge paws, swayed them tentatively and
gave a shove.
</p>

<p>
The ladder teetered erect on end, poised as if to drop
back against the cliff&mdash;and went over backward, spilling
its load of priests to an accompaniment of fearful screams.
</p>

<p>
"Now we got a better chance, eh?" commented the Dutchman.
</p>

<p>
Kachina chuckled with amusement.  She had adopted our
side unreservedly.  The death of these people who had
lately almost worshiped her distressed her no more than
the slaying of the Awataba in the pass.
</p>

<p>
"That was a good blow for the fat one," she remarked.
"They will set up the ladder again, but we shall have more
time, and that means everything."
</p>

<p>
"How?" I questioned, as I strove to discern a way of
escape from the scanty foothold of the rock-ledge.
</p>

<p>
"I will show you," she answered.  "This is a secret path
of the priests.  Wiki used it when he went into the desert
to commune with Massi.  But it is very dangerous, and
you who are not accustomed to climbing the rocks will have
to go slowly.  That is why I say the fat one did well to
overthrow the ladder.  Before they dare to set it up again we
shall be able to climb beyond their reach."
</p>

<p>
She took Tawannears by the hand.  He led me, and
Peter brought up the rear, and we edged cautiously along
the shelf, blessed by our blindness in that we could not see
how perilously near eternity we walked.  Some twenty feet
from where the ladder had rested the ledge terminated
in a series of foot- and hand-holds ascending a slope, and
these we climbed by touch.  In that pitch darkness 'twas
impossible for one to see the others ahead of him.  But we
hurried, for behind us we heard the ladder creaking back
into place.
</p>

<p>
The third stage of the path was another ledge, which
carried us into a remarkable crevice in the face of the
cliff, a kind of natural chimney, evidently a fault in the
rock structure caused by some bygone disturbance of the
earth's surface.  In the crevice it was darker than it had
been outside, if that was possible; but the footing was
more secure, and we were spurred on by the sounds of
our pursuers, better accustomed to such work than we and
consequently making twice as rapid progress.
</p>

<p>
The path was made easier by occasional foot-rests
chopped by the priests and by ladder-rungs braced in
holes.  It trended at first directly into the heart of the cliff,
then turned at right angles and ascended diagonally,
following a layer of soft rock which I could readily identify
with my hands.  In two places it was so steep as to demand
progress by means of straddling.  Atop of the first of
these funnels it widened to become a chamber littered with
rock fragments, and a beam of moonlight filtered into the
somber place revealed a jagged crack along the side toward
the valley.
</p>

<p>
Peter, following me up the second funnel, muttered he
could see one of the priests climbing the slant of the path
to its beginning, and in my energy to make way for him
I deluged him with pebbles and fine gravel.  This upper
end of the crevice was very brittle, perhaps because it had
been long baked in the heat of the sun, and we slipped and
slid continually, losing a foot for every yard we scaled.
But at last Kachina achieved the top, and helped Tawannears
up, and betwixt them, they hauled up Peter and me.
</p>

<p>
To our surprise, we discovered ourselves to be on the
summit of the cliff.  Homolobi, of course, was hidden beneath
the protuberance of rock that ran eastward many feet
from where we stood.  Beyond it, though, we could see
the full sweep of the valley, dotted with the fires of the
Awataba, the silver glitter of the moonlight on the river
and the opposite wall of cliffs.  The night was very bright
and clear, the sky gemmed with a myriad stars, the moon
shining full between draperies of purple velvet.
</p>

<p>
"What now!" I asked.
</p>

<p>
Kachina shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"We must keep back the priests from following us,"
she said.  "If we left the path they would soon be close to
us again."
</p>

<p>
"And if we wait," I returned, "they will send back
messengers to guide the Awataba here by some other trail.
Perhaps they have already done so."
</p>

<p>
"True," she agreed coolly.  "Well, so far I have planned
for you.  It is time you took thought to save yourselves."
</p>

<p>
I translated this to the others, and Peter strode instantly
to an enormous boulder, lying on its side in a bed
of shale.
</p>

<p>
"We put a cork in der bottle," he announced.
</p>

<p>
He leaned his shoulder against the boulder, heaved and
it rolled over toward the head of the funnel.  Another heave
and another, and it rested on the funnel's lip.  Peter shoved
it with his right arm, there was a shower of gravel, a
startled yelp from the bowels of the rocks, and he turned
to us, with a broad grin.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>, dot's a goodt&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I thought the end of the world had come.  Deep underneath
there was a heavy jar, then a sullen, sky-piercing
roar that resounded and reëchoed, pounding our ears,
dazing our senses, louder, ever louder, swelling and bursting
into prodigious thunder-peals.  A dense cloud of dust
rose like a curtain around us.  The rock on which we stood
jumped as though it had been struck with the hammer of
a god.  The roar slid off into a declining repetition of
earth-shocks.  The dust settled slowly.  And we looked
from a sheer precipice at our feet upon what had been
Homolobi.
</p>

<p>
Peter's boulder, bounding down the funnel in the cliff,
must have encountered a fault in the rock, possibly the
jagged crack I had noted above the first funnel, and with
the momentum it had gathered and its accompanying wave
of small stones and gravel, had started forces which had
torn from the face of the cliff the overhanging projection
which had shielded Homolobi from attack for centuries.
This mass, in falling, had planed off the top of the Breast,
and was now a sloping hill of rock fragments which
stretched far into the valley.
</p>

<p>
Under it lay the people and the houses of Homolobi,
their storehouses and choicest gardens and most of the
Awataba, who had gathered close to the foot of the Breast
to await the issue of their demands.  It was the most
utter, tragic ruin I have ever seen.  The dust clouds
seethed above the wreckage like the smoke of successful
fires, but no fires could have been so successful.  There were
not left even ruins or ashes.  Homolobi was abolished.  It
was gone without a trace to show where it had been.
</p>

<p>
Kachina cast herself at Tawannears' feet.
</p>

<p>
"How mighty are your gods!" she moaned.  "I am
yours.  Save me from them."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears lifted her in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Gahano need have no fear," he said proudly.  "Tawannears'
medicine is strong.  All who oppose him shall perish.
But Gahano is safe.  Surely, Hawenneyu has us in His
keeping that he should visit such destruction upon our
enemies!  He will send the Honochenokeh to guard us.
Tharon the Sky-holder will let the clouds fall upon those
who stand in our way.  Gaoh will blow the winds against
them.  Tawannears' orenda will triumph over all!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
THE SPOTTED STALLION
</h3>

<p>
We were free, but new problems arose to confront
us.  Our only weapons were the knives and tomahawks
in our belts.  We were stranded all but
defenseless in a desolate, unknown country.  Without the
protection afforded by our muskets 'twas exceedingly
doubtful whether we could travel far in face of strong
hostile opposition.  The Awataba, any tribe of archers,
easily could overwhelm us.  Moreover, Winter was coming
on.  Autumn was actually at hand.  There were the twin
questions of food and shelter to be answered.  And finally,
we had a fourth comrade to feed, protect and clothe.
</p>

<p>
But on this final score we had no occasion for worry,
as events soon showed.  Kachina might acclaim the superior
accessibility which Tawannears enjoyed with the high
gods, but her native self-reliance, courage and intelligence
refused to acknowledge the handicap of her sex.  At the
very beginning of her association with us she claimed and
fulfilled the rôle of an equal&mdash;proving in this, as in countless
other ways, that she was of Spanish blood, no ordinary
Indian maiden to accept meekly the drab duties of a
squaw.  Tawannears, somewhat to my amusement, accepted
her at her own valuation.
</p>

<p>
The Seneca possessed a streak of innate chivalry entirely
different from the normal attitude of courteous toleration
which the People of the Long House entertain for their
women.  No nation anywhere that I have read of in history
give their wives and mothers greater honor than these
barbarians of the forest.  'Tis the women who select the
candidates for the high rank of Royaneh, the noble group
of leaders who form the Hoyarnagowar, the ruling body
of the Great League.  They arrange marriages, and largely
control clan politics.  A warrior of the Hodenosaunee says
that he is the son of his mother, not of his father, when
you ask his name.  Beyond all other Indians, ay, and
beyond all white men they yield power and place to women.
</p>

<p>
But as a race they treat women as a sex apart.  The lives
the men live are denied to the women.  Of love, in the sense
that we entertain it, an affection transcending the
arbitrary bounds of physical affinity, they are ignorant.
Tawannears, alone, joined to the sex courtesy of the
Hodenosaunee the white man's capacity for a flaming spiritual
devotion.  He loved with all his being, he worshiped, he
felt a joyous sense of service based on an equality of
partnership.  So much, at least, of what they sought to
achieve the missionaries had wrought into his character.
Let it be said for them that they supplied him with the
mainspring of his life.
</p>

<p>
So it was that, having asserted the protection of his
gods, the superiority of his orenda over all powers which
might be brought against it, he proceeded, with the naïveté
that was a cardinal point of his character, to admit the
validity of the aid she was able to give us, aid without
which, I believe, we must have perished.  Nor did he then
or ever treat her as a squaw, a woman to be honored in the
lodge and debarred from warriors' councils.  And this, I
must say clearly, has seemed most odd to me.  For the
real Gahano or any other Indian maid must naturally have
adopted the habits, the ways of thought, bred into her.
Yet never did Tawannears doubt the truth of the miraculous
exploit he credited to himself.
</p>

<p>
So sure was he that he never mentioned it thereafterward.
It had been a gift from Hawenneyu, a recognition
of human endurance and loyalty.  Very well, then, he took
what Hawenneyu gave, offered thanks and went his way.
Why talk of the obvious?  Anyone, so Tawannears reasoned
in his blend of Christian philosophy and pagan faith, who
strove hard enough could do what he had done.  It had been
done before, he believed.  He did not even question the
failure of Jouskeha&mdash;or Wiki&mdash;to seal his Lost Soul in
the pumpkin-shell in which she had first appeared, and
deliver her to him so.  The gods, no more than men, must
do a thing in the same way each time they undertook it.
They had acted toward him as they saw fit.  He refused to
quibble over details.  He was satisfied.
</p>

<p>
I have said that without Kachina we should have
perished.  Mayhap I exaggerate, but nevertheless 'tis true
that she was the means of guiding us from the cliff-top
above the grave of Homolobi down to the valley-floor,
which we had need to pass to gain the Eastern vents.
'Twas she who skirted the ragged mound the rock-slide
had formed, and solved the first of our difficulties by
retrieving two bows and a quiver of arrows which certain
of the Awataba had cast aside in flight.  As weapons these
were not much, crudely made, lightly strung, with
flint-tipped arrows none too straight or dependable in flight;
but they were better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
Kachina, too, collected corn and vegetables from the
standing fields and gardens on the far side of the river,
which had been undamaged by the catastrophe, and with
these she cooked us tasty stews that helped us to fight down
the pangs of hunger we experienced as meat-eaters.  And
'twas she who knocked over a turkey of one of the village
flocks and afforded us thus a more substantial meal the
next evening.  And she knew the best passes and ravines
leading from the valley, and saved us weeks of wandering,
and very likely, death from starvation or at the hand of
some hostile tribe, when we resumed our journey to the
East.
</p>

<p>
She was a maid as quick in wit and devotion as in temper,
scornful of Peter's bulk whilst she respected his strength,
affecting for me an amused toleration as of one incomparably
aged, an incumbrance to be admitted for sake of
Tawannears.  I think at first she was attracted by the
Seneca because of the novelty of his case, the strange part
it gave her to play, the whimsical sensation of being one
reborn again, an accepted intimate and favorite of the
gods.  But there can be no question she grew to love him
with devotion akin to his own.  He was a man amongst
millions, ay, in the very words she used, a <i>Man</i>!
</p>

<p>
Both Peter and I, whom she plagued and teased like
the child she was, came to love her as a sister and a true
comrade, and because of her mingling of Indian
unconsciousness and stoicism and white woman's coy mannerisms.
'Twas Peter, for instance, insisted upon taking from her
the ridiculous costume of turkey feathers, which was all
she had to wear.  For herself, she gave it not a second's
thought.  I daresay it was fairly warm if unsubstantial,
and she had as little false modesty as might be expected
in one who was convinced of her semi-divinity.  Peter
fashioned for her instead a neat costume of moccasins,
breeches and coat, which he contrived from his own
raiment, going afterward almost as naked as the Awataba
until good fortune threw in our way the chance to replenish
ourselves.  But I am again galloping in advance of my
story, an ill trick, and to be attributed to the garrulity of
old memories stirred afresh.
</p>

<p>
With weapons and food for the time being, our next
concern was as to shelter for the Winter, and on this point
we were all agreed: we desired to get as far as possible
from this valley of death before the cold weather and the
terrible snows prevented traveling, and inasmuch as
Tawannears' search was ended there was no question but that
we should go east.  Had we been by ourselves we three
would have elected to follow the stream which flowed
through the plantations of what had been Homolobi&mdash;and
we should have been led hundreds of miles to the southward.
It was by Kachina's advice that we chose a ravine
which carried us due east into a more favorable country,
where game was abundant.
</p>

<p>
We had feared the attentions of the remnants of the
Awataba, but if any were left they gave us a wide berth,
nor did we see signs of other savages, until we came to
a considerable river some four days' journey from the
edge of the rock desert, where we were attacked by a small
band of stalwart warriors, whom Kachina called Navahu.
They came at us boldly, seeing how few we were, and we
pretended to flee behind a thicket; but as they approached
us there we charged upon them with heavy clubs of wood
that Peter had cut, and at the sight of our white, bearded
faces they lost all their ardor and tried to escape, crying
that we were Naakai, by which, it seems, they meant
Spaniards.  We overtook and plundered several of them,
besides raiding their camp on the river-bank, and so
became possessed of some handsomely woven robes or
blankets, which Kachina assured us were highly prized by
all the tribes in these regions.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto Peter and I had been obliged to content ourselves
with clubs to supplement our knives and tomahawks,
it being manifestly the wisest policy to award our two
bows to Tawannears and Kachina, who were more expert
archers than we.  Now we acquired two more bows and
nearly two quivers full of arrows, and plucking up our
courage, deemed ourselves equipped to encounter any
resistance short of musketry.  We swam the river without
difficulty, and continued east, being halted presently by a
barrier of foothills beyond a smaller stream.  Long since
we had passed the confines of Kachina's narrow geographical
knowledge, and after discussing the situation we
decided to follow this stream north.
</p>

<p>
When it turned abruptly west three days afterward
we were crestfallen, but we agreed to keep to its banks
for one day more; and our perseverance was rewarded, for
we discovered that it flowed into a larger river, apparently
the one we had first crossed, which seemed to come down
from the northeast.  'Twas in this direction we felt vaguely
that we should aim, and we made the best progress the
broken ground afforded.  Several days' rough traveling
brought us to a third stream, which joined our river from
the east.  Ahead loomed range after range of rocky peaks;
southeast the prospect* was also forbidding.  We made the
only decision possible, and headed east up the course of
this new river.  Of course, it might have carried us anywhere,
as in this land the streams seemed to be coming from
and flowing toward all directions; but it was our good
fortune that its head waters were high on the western slopes
of the Sky Mountains, and we were able to Winter in a
glorious valley such as had been our home the year previous.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Ormerod's course grows increasingly difficult to trace, but I
hazard a guess he came out of some point in the Wasatch Mountains
of Utah, crossed the Grand and followed that river to the
Gunnison.&mdash;A.D.H S.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We built a comfortable cabin of two rooms, and had all
the food we needed.  Indeed, we grew fat and sleek, and
Peter, with his clever hands, made us new garments of
deerskin.  The blankets we had captured from the Navahu
kept us warm.  And we whiled away the hours when we
were not hunting or working on pelts by cutting and
straightening arrow shafts, chipping and fastening
stone-heads and adjusting the feathering.  We were
better armed than ever, and Peter and I improved
in our shooting, although we could never hope to rival
archers like Tawannears and Kachina, who had drawn
bows since childhood&mdash;just as they were incomparably
less expert than the marvelous bowmen of the Plains tribes,
who spend their whole lives in attaining proficiency in
this weapon, thanks to their being entirely dependent upon
it and unable to secure firearms.
</p>

<p>
Spring set us afoot again.  We delayed our departure
from the cabin until we were certain the last snow storm
had blanketed the mountains, but once we started we moved
rapidly, as Tawannears had shaped snow-shoes for all of
us, and the soggy crust packed firm.  Two weeks' journey
fetched us across a divide of land, a mountain-ridge
running due north and south; and we descended by a series
of valleys which carried us out of the mountains through
a gateway betwixt two gigantic peaks that reared
skyward many miles apart.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* This tends to confirm the theory that Ormerod followed the
Gunnison east, crossed the Continental Divide near Gannon City,
and came down into the valley of the Arkansas, with Pike's Peak
on his left and Spanish Peak visible in the distance.&mdash;A.D.H.S.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We encountered a river flowing east, which already was
gathering size and force from the melting snows of countless
minor streams.  For want of more accurate guidance
we followed its Southern bank, abandoning it twice, when
it seemed to deviate to the north, and striking eastward
in a bee line, although in each of these instances we picked
up the river again.
</p>

<p>
On this comparatively low tableland the snow had
disappeared, and the long grass and foliage were greening
out.  There was no lack of antelope and deer, and we saw
frequent herds of buffalo, the advance-guards of the vast
migrations which were shifting from the Southern
feeding-grounds.  We were now in the country of the horse
Indians, those wide-ranging tribes whose bands ride hundreds
of miles for a handful of booty or a scalp, lovers of fighting
by preference, and we were at pains to avoid all contact
with them.  Twice we hid in the grass to let gorgeously
feathered parties ride past.  Once we lay in a patch of
timber by the river-bank, unable to move, and watched
a band make camp.
</p>

<p>
But we could not hope to be successful always, especially
as the country became flatter and less adaptable for
concealment as we traveled east.  There arrived a day when
the river looped north, and we abandoned it for the third
time, squaring our backs to the westering sun and entrusting
ourselves to the open plains.  The grass here was still
short of its midsummer luxuriance.  Cover was negligible,
and the land rolled evenly in gigantic swells.  We were
climbing one of these, weary and anxious to reach a
water-supply, as a war-party rode over the crest, fifty painted
warriors in breech-clouts and moccasins, long hair stuck
with feathers, white shields and lance-points glistening,
quivers bristling with arrows.
</p>

<p>
They howled their amazement, and swept down upon us,
two of their number racing up the swell behind us to make
sure we were not the bait of a larger band, lying in
ambush.  We bunched together, and made the peace sign,
arms upthrust, palms out.  But the newcomers rode
wearily around us in a contracting circle, their lances slung,
arrows notched, ready to overwhelm us with a rain of
shafts.  They carried hornbound bows that could shoot
twice as far as ours.  When the scouts scurried back
with yells of reassurance, they reduced the circle they
had strung until we were fairly within bow-shot from all
sides.  Then a chief, resplendent in eagle's feathers, hailed
us in a sonorous dialect marked by rolling r's.  Tawannears
started at the words.
</p>

<p>
"They are the Nemene, or Comanche," he exclaimed.
"We are in grave danger, brothers.  These men are the
mightiest raiders on the plains."
</p>

<p>
"Shall we fight them?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," approved Kachina, notching an arrow.  "Let us
fight them."
</p>

<p>
"What does der chief say?" asked Peter.  "Can you
understand?"
</p>

<p>
"A part.  I have heard the Comanches talk when they
came North to trade with the Dakota.  I will try them in
Dakota."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears shouted his answer, and the Comanche chief
summoned a warrior to interpret.
</p>

<p>
"He asks who we are," Tawannears explained swiftly
after a brief interchange of words.  "I have told him.  He
says that we must come with him to his camp."
</p>

<p>
There was another interchange of remarks.
</p>

<p>
"I have told him we are hurrying to our own land,
that we mean no harm to his people, but he will not agree
to let us go.  He says we are on his people's land, and
we should have asked permission to come here.  I will say
that we were looking for him, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Tawannears shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Once more the shouted questions and answers, accompanied
by signs and gestures, and the ring of warriors
commenced to weave around us again.  The chief rode
leisurely to one side, and regarded us indifferently.  His
interpreter shouted two words.
</p>

<p>
"It is no use, brothers," said Tawannears.  "We are
to throw down our weapons or they shoot."
</p>

<p>
"Is it a question of dying now or later?" I asked
resentfully.
</p>

<p>
"It looks so."
</p>

<p>
"Let us die here in the open," proposed Kachina fearlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Nein," spoke up Peter.  "If we fight here, we die,
Dot's sure.  If we go with dem, we die&mdash;maype.  Berhaps
not.  Not sure, eh?  We petter go, andt wait andt see.
<i>Ja!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The Dutchman was right.  We dropped our weapons,
and the ring of Comanches swirled in upon itself.  We
were suddenly in the midst of a sweating mob of men and
horses, scowling faces bent over us, rough hands snatching
at our possessions; rawhide thongs were lashed about our
waists, and the cavalcade dashed away between the swells,
each of us running fast to keep up with the horseman who
had us in tow, plenty of careless hoofs ready to beat our
brains out if we stumbled.  But after the first mile they
lessened the pace, and toward evening we rode into a circle
of teepees pitched on the bank of a tiny river.
</p>

<p>
On one side was a grove of trees, reaching to the
high-water mark.  Opposite, the pony herd grazed in a
natural meadow.  We were bound hand and foot and
suffered to lie on the grass betwixt the easternmost of the
teepees and the horse herd, the adolescents of the
herd-guard being summoned to watch us.  The chief and his
warriors, after exhibiting us to a group of several hundred
people, including women and children, shooed them all
away and left us, evidently to decide how to treat
us&mdash;which, apparently, meant how to end us.
</p>

<p>
The shadows lengthened steadily, but nobody brought
us food.  Now and then a man lounged over to test our
bindings or look at us.  Women and children who sought
to stare at us further were importantly warned off by
the adolescents of the herd-guard.  The light was failing,
too&mdash;so much so that I was surprised at feeling a cold
muzzle thrust against my cheek.  A delighted whinny
greeted me.
</p>

<p>
I twisted my head around, and looked up into the quivering
nostrils of a mottled stallion.  He nuzzled me again,
whinnying with every appearance of recognition, his white
mane ruffling in pleasure.  I spoke to him softly, and he
buried his muzzle in my neck, pawing with his forehoof
as though inviting me to rise and mount him.  Yes, there
was no doubt of it.  He was Sunkawakan-kedeshka, the
spotted horse, that I had tamed at Nadoweiswe's Teton
village in the North before we first crossed the Sky
Mountains.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
THE STAMPEDE
</h3>

<p>
"What is this, brother?" whispered Tawannears
beside me.
</p>

<p>
I explained, and Kachina and Peter rolled
closer to listen.
</p>

<p>
"Wah!" gasped the girl, when I had finished.  "This
god Hawenneyu is a great god!  He has sent the horse to
aid us to escape."
</p>

<p>
"How can that be?" I answered her peevishly.  "We
lie here bound and helpless.  If the whole herd came and
waited next the stallion we could not use them."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless, it is good medicine," insisted
Tawannears.  "My heart grows strong again."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," agreed Peter with more interest than he usually
exhibited.  "We hafe der middle of an egscape.  If we
get der first part&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Sunkawakan-kedeshka's silken ears shot forward across
my face.  I heard the padding of moccasined feet.
</p>

<p>
"The herd-guard!" I exclaimed.  "Remember, I am
crying out in fear.  The stallion is biting me."
</p>

<p>
And straightway I gave vent to a series of fearsome
shrieks, at which the spotted stallion drew back in
amazement, unable to understand the antics of the man he
considered his friend.  The youthful herdsman broke into
a run, and Tawannears hailed him in a mixture of Dakota
and Comanche phrases:
</p>

<p>
"Come quickly!  Is this the way to treat captives?  The
horse is biting my white brother!"
</p>

<p>
The Comanche laughed, peering through the starlit
darkness, and I noted with interest that as soon as he
identified the horse he approached with marked caution.
</p>

<p>
"The spotted horse will give him an easier death than
our warriors at the torture-stake," he exulted.  "What are
teeth and hoofs to the knife and fire?  If I leave the horse
he will soon make an end of the Taivo.*  But to-morrow
will tell another story.  The Taivo will linger for hours,
begging for the hatchet."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* White man.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"They say your father would dress you in women's
garb and beat you with switches if any harm came to the
Taivo before the Council decided his fate," said Tawannears
sternly.  "Mount the horse and ride him away."
</p>

<p>
"Mount the spotted horse!" returned the boy with derision.
"Never!  Not one of our warriors has been able to
back him since we raided him from the Teton."
</p>

<p>
"No, for they are Comanches," sneered Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
The boy dealt him a lusty kick in the ribs, and drove
off the stallion with thrusts of the light lance he carried.
Hoofs sawing and teeth flashing, Sunkawakan-kedeshka
gave me one look of regret, emitted a whinny of hurt
inquiry and faded into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Peter, by the middle of an escape?"
I whispered curiously as soon as the herd-guard was out
of hearing.
</p>

<p>
"Der first part," answered the Dutchman, "is getting
off der thongs.  Dot we hafe to do.  Der middle part is
finding a way to leafe der village.  Dot we hafe in der
horse&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"How?" demanded Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"He is a king of horses," returned Peter placidly.
"Hafe you forgot der lidtle band of mares he ledt at
Nadoweiswe's village?  What he does, der herd will do."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis true," I assented eagerly.  "With him to aid
us we could stampede the herd."
</p>

<p>
"But why talk of such things when we are helpless?"
was Tawannears' gloomy comment.
</p>

<p>
"We are not helpless," interrupted Kachina.
</p>

<p>
She rolled herself over and over until she lay on her
stomach close to Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"The warrior who bound my wrists did not tie them so
tight as yours," she explained.  "I smiled at him, and I
think he means to ask the Comanche chief to let him take
me into his teepee&mdash;the ant!  If he did I would kill him
with his own knife.  If your teeth are sharp as mine you
can gnaw the knots loose.  Then I will free the rest of
you."
</p>

<p>
And as Tawannears hesitated in bewilderment at her
suggestion, she continued:
</p>

<p>
"Hurry!  The eagles are singing of victory in the sky.
They say we shall defy the Comanche."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," I pleaded.  "Make haste, brother.  The
herd-guards may come again."
</p>

<p>
So Tawannears rolled himself into a position where he
could bring his strong teeth&mdash;the teeth of a barbarian,
exempt from white man's ills&mdash;to bear upon the girl's
knotted wrists, triced in the small of her back just above
the hips.  And whilst he labored at the tough hide thongs,
Peter and I kept watch for the return of the adolescent.
Had he come we planned to give warning, and Kachina
and Tawannears would have resumed their customary
attitudes but we saw no more of him.  I think he and his
friends were taking turns sneaking into the village to
listen outside the Council teepee to the debate of the
warriors on our fate, and this meant more work for those
watching the grazing horses.  For twice I heard the
distant whinny of Sunkawakan-kedeshka, evidently
challenging my attention, and I suspect it required one boy's
vigilance to restrict his wanderings, alone.
</p>

<p>
Time dragged slowly, and the Seneca's lips became
slippery with blood from his torn gums.  I took his place,
and when I was worn out, Peter's heavy jaws assumed the
burden.  'Twas he wrenched the last knot loose; but
several moments passed before Kachina was able to restore the
circulation in her hands.  Then she unbound her ankles,
and without waiting to rub her feet back to life, fell to
upon our lashings.  In ten minutes we were all four free,
crawling&mdash;we could not have walked had we tried&mdash;toward
the herd.
</p>

<p>
Our plan was simple.  It had to be.  We advanced until
we could descry the figures of two of the herd-guards
against the faint starlight, unkempt, naked striplings,
lances wandlike in their right hands.  On this, the village
side, the task was easier, and so most of the guards
were on the flanks and opposite to our position.  Beyond
the two guards was the restless mass of horses, some
hundreds of them, grazing, fighting, rolling, sleeping.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears and I stripped off our shirts and breeches,
and so assumed the general aspect of Comanche warriors,
crawled back a short distance and then ran forward openly,
as though we were carrying a message from the village.
The two guards heard the patter of our moccasins and rode
in to meet us, quite guileless, probably taking us for
certain of their comrades.  When they called to us, we
answered with grunts, puffing mightily.  They never
suspected us.  I was beside my man, had one hand on his
thigh, before he guessed aught was wrong, and as he opened
his mouth to cry a warning I had him by the throat and
throttled the life out of him.  His cry was no more than
a gurgle in the night.  Tawannears was even more
expeditious.
</p>

<p>
To our left we heard another pair of guards talking
together.  They may have detected the choked cry of the
one I killed.  At any rate, we could not afford to pause to
establish a plan for meeting them.  Tawannears softly
called up Kachina and Peter, and I rode into the herd,
whistling for Sunkawakan-kedeshka.  He answered me at
once.  A long-drawn-out whinny of delight, and he battered
his way to my side with flying hoofs.  I swung from
the herd-guard's horse to his back, and trotted over to
my friends.
</p>

<p>
"Quick, brother!" hissed Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
He pointed at two mounted figures that loomed perilously
close.  One of them hailed at that moment, mistaking
me for a brother guard.  I growled something indistinct
in my throat, and heaved Kachina up in front of me,
holding her in my arms and twisting my fingers in the
stallion's mane in place of reins.  He did not tremble
under the extra weight, only tossed his head and
wickered&mdash;much to my gratitude, for I was by no means sure how
he would regard a double load, and I could not leave the
girl by herself, considering she had never ridden before,
nor to one of the others who were scarcely less ignorant of
horsemanship.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears and Peter climbed gingerly on the horses
of the slain guards, and we plunged into the center of the
herd.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ha-yah-yah-yaaaa-aaa-aa-ah-hhh-yeeee-eee-ee!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The war-whoop of the Long House split the silence of the
night.  I excited Sunkawakan-kedeshka to a frenzy.
Tawannears and Peter thrust right and left with their
captured lances.  Half-tamed at best, these horses were
restless of all restraint, and they reacted immediately to
the turmoil.  A shrill scream from the spotted stallion
produced a chorus of responses.  Mares fought to reach
his side.  Other stallions fought to keep them away.  The
herd went wild.  Kicking, biting, neighing, screaming, it
smashed aside the efforts of the herd guards to stop it and
pelted southeast into the open prairie.
</p>

<p>
And in the midst of it my comrades swayed in their
seats, in danger at any instant of being knocked to the
ground.  And Kachina and I clung desperately to the
bare back of the stallion, his great muscles lifting him
along at a stride which soon placed him in the fore of the
stampede.
</p>

<p>
I saw one boy go down in the path of the mad rush, he
and his mount trampled to a pulp.  Others rode wide,
shouting the alarm.  The village behind us rocked to the
thunder of hoofs; a cry of dismay rose to the stars that
blinked in the dim vault overhead.  Then teepees, herd-guards,
warriors, trees and river were gone in the darkness.
We were alone with our plunder on the prairie, all around
us tossing heads and manes, flirting hoofs, lean barrels
stretched close to the ground, tails flicking the grass-tips.
</p>

<p>
Mile after mile, the cavalcade pounded on, and I knew
the discomforts my comrades must be suffering.  But I
could not stop.  Nobody could have stopped that wild
flight.  I doubt if I could have stopped the spotted
stallion in the first hour.  All I could do was to grip him
tight with my knees, cling to Kachina and pray he and his
fellows would pick fair ground in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
It was near dawn when I judged there was a chance of
success to stay the herd.  I began with the stallion, calming
him, soothing his nerves, and gradually, my influence
extended to the horses surrounding him, mostly his attendant
mares, as well as a few colts.  No foals could have
kept up with our rush.  In fact, we had been dropping
horses by the way for three hours or more.  Those that
were left were the hardiest, and their eyes were bloodshot,
their flanks wet with foam, their lungs bursting.
I slowed the troop to a canter, to a trot, Tawannears and
Peters seconding me as well as they could.  Finally, we
pulled them to a walk, and induced them to graze.
</p>

<p>
I felt safe enough.  We had traveled at a terrible pace,
and the Comanche had no means of keeping up with us.
Also, we were all exhausted, and I had designs for making
use of our plunder which made me unwilling to founder
the herd.  So we sought shelter in a grove of trees, driving
in there the stallion's immediate following, and permitting
the other horses to graze at will, whilst we four slept
through the forenoon.
</p>

<p>
Upon awaking, we killed a colt for food, taking pains
to dispatch him in a part of the wood down-wind from his
kind, and after eating I put into effect the plan I had
designed to cover our future trail.  Tawannears, Peter and
I cut out of the ruck of the herd a score of the choicest
ponies, which we drove into the wood to join
Sunkawakan-kedeshka's cohort, guarded for the time being by
Kachina.  And this being done, we chased the remainder
south, frightening them with bunches of burning grass.
If the Comanches or others picked up our trail now they
would be much more likely to follow the larger body, as
was evidenced by the area of hoof-prints, and we might
continue undisturbed upon our eastward journey, with
a quantity of superfluous horseflesh to trade for weapons or
food, besides a provision of mounts for ourselves to expedite
our progress.
</p>

<p>
We left the grove at sunset and rode at a leisurely pace
until the stars told us it was midnight, camping in the
open close to a rivulet where there was ample grass and
water for the horses.  The next day we traveled as far
as a second grove of trees on the banks of a considerable
stream, which we concluded was the river we had followed
eastward from the base of the Sky Mountains, and we
made a halt of two days here to rest the herd and determine
in our minds what our next step should be.  I was all for
continuing as we were, but Tawannears and Peter held
that our wisest course was to cross the river and head
north to the Dakota country, where we should be among
friends and might be able to rely upon an escort to the
Mississippi.  But, as usual, fate intervened, and relieved
us of the burden of the decision.
</p>

<p>
We were arguing back and forth on the afternoon of the
second day, the horses grazing in the confines of the grove
under the supervision of Kachina, who, with a little practice,
had become as skilled a herd-guard as a shepherdess of
turkeys, when we were disturbed by a call from her.  She
beckoned us to the bluff above the river.
</p>

<p>
"Strange people over there," she said, pointing.
</p>

<p>
The stream here was not more than a hundred or two hundred
yards wide and in the clear air we could see the
newcomers distinctly.  They were plainly a returning
war-party, travel-stained, badly cut-up, the worse for their
adventures.  Of sixty or more warriors within view ten or a
dozen bore evidence of wounds.  Their lances were broken.
Their buffalo-hide shields were cut and hacked.  But their
horses were in the saddest plight of all.  One lay down and
died as we looked.  Others could never move from where
they stood.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears' eyes gleamed.
</p>

<p>
"Here is fresh favor from Hawenneyu," he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"How so!" I demanded.
</p>

<p>
"These people need horses.  We need arms.  We will
make a trade with them."
</p>

<p>
"They look like very bad people," objected Kachina.
</p>

<p>
And in all truth, they were an evil group of swart,
thick-set, cruel-visaged savages.
</p>

<p>
"No matter," asserted the Seneca.  "They are on the far
side of the stream from us.  We will see that they stay there
until we have finished our business with them.  Otetiani
and Tawannears will ride across and talk to their chief,
and Gahano and Peter must move briskly about the wood
to appear a numerous band.  Lead the horses around where
they can be seen.  Call to one another.  Walk about where
they can see a part of you.  We shall fool them.  Their need
is bitter."
</p>

<p>
None of us was disposed to argue with him, for if the
need of the strange savages was bitter, ours was no
less so.  We had two lances wherewith to hunt and
to defend ourselves, not even a knife amongst the four of
us.  Weapons we must have to dare traverse this tremendous
sweep of open country, roamed by the most predacious
Indians on the continent.
</p>

<p>
I whistled up the spotted stallion and one of his mares,
and Tawannears and I mounted and rose forth from the
trees, making a great play as we came into the open on the
river bank of handing over our lances and other dummy
weapons to Peter, who straightway marched back into the
wood.  We also pretended to shout orders to different points
along the bank, and the Dutchman and Kachina whooped
the answers to us or responded with whistle-signals.  The
band on the opposite bank had dragged themselves to their
feet, and stared sullenly at us as we splashed into the
shallows, and with upraised arms signaling peace.
</p>

<p>
"They look much stouter than any tribe we have seen,"
I remarked.  "Why, they wear body-armor, cuirasses of
buffalo-hide.  There is one who has an arrow still sticking
under his arm."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears frowned.
</p>

<p>
"Kachina was right," he said.  "These are bad people.
I remember now.  They are the Tonkawa."*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Literal meaning&mdash;"They-all-stay-together."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Who are they!" I asked.
</p>

<p>
We were not yet within earshot of them as they clustered
on the bank.
</p>

<p>
"Chatanskah often told Tawannears of them when I first
dwelt with Corlaer in his teepee years ago.  They are the
scourge of the plains.  They have no home, but go wherever
they please, hunting and killing.  Their hands are raised
against all other people's.  They have no allies, no brothers.
They make no treaties.  They never receive ambassadors.
They are ravaging one year in the Spanish countries in the
South, or matching lances with the Apache; and the year
after they strike the Dakota or the Cheyenne.  They are
like the wolf-pack.  They never abandon their prey, and
you must kill all before they abandon an attack.  Their
favorite food is human flesh."
</p>

<p>
I shuddered, eying askance the bestial visages lowering
on the bank, faces as depraved, if more intelligent, than
those of the Awataba.
</p>

<p>
"And we are to bargain with these!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"We must, brother.  They are great warriors.  If we
yield to them they will think we fear them, and they will
pursue us.  Our horses would be bait enough.  No, we have
come so far, and we cannot draw back.  We must carry it
with a high hand.  Be bold.  Scowl at them.  Show
contempt.  We have them at our mercy, but it is not convenient
for us to attack.  That is our position."
</p>

<p>
We kicked our horses up the slope of the bank, and drew
rein in the midst of the half-circle of Tonkawa warriors.
Not a weapon was displayed, for that would have been a
gross violation of Indian etiquette, and even these
freebooters respected the fundamental precepts of the race to
some extent.  But we were subtly made to feel that every
man there itched to twist his knife in our hearts.
</p>

<p>
I found myself drawing back my lips from my teeth in
an animalistic snarl of reciprocal hatred as Tawannears
thrust out his two hands with the forefingers crossed at
right angles, the figure in the universal sign-language for
the desire to trade.  When a young warrior tried to crowd
his horse closer I touched Sunkawakan-kedeshka with my
heel, and the spotted stallion shoved the offender off the
bank.  The youngster scrambled up again, a murderous
look on his face, but the Tonkawa chief, a broad-shouldered
giant of a man, wearing the hide cuirass and a feathered
helmet, spat out a guttural order which curbed the tide
of hatred.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" he demanded roughly in the
broken jargon of Comanche, which passed for the trade
language of the plains.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
OUR TRADE WITH THE TONKAWAS
</h3>

<p>
"We hold this ford," replied Tawannears in the
same dialect, speaking with arrogant emphasis.
The two conducted their conversation after the
remarkable fashion of the Plains tribes, the basis of their
speech being such Comanche phrases as they had in
common, pieced out with Dakota, Pawnee, Arickara, Cheyenne
and Siksika, and when they were at a loss for a common
vocal ground of understanding reverting to the flexible
sign-language, by which they never failed to convey the most
complicated meanings.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally one of the leading Tonkawa warriors would
intervene with a suggestion or a word if his chief seemed
at a loss, but the debate was mainly a two-man affair.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" returned the Tonkawa haughtily, yet
impressed by our swaggering manner.
</p>

<p>
"We are of no tribe," said Tawannears.  "We are
outlaws and fugitives.  We ravage all whom we meet."
</p>

<p>
"Not the Tonkawa," commented the chief, with what on
a civilized face I would have termed a grin of mild
amusement.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the Tonkawa, if they attempt to cross us," rejoined
Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"How many of the Taivo have you in your band?"
inquired the Tonkawa, changing the subject.
</p>

<p>
"We have many," Tawannears lied easily.  "This one
you see with me is an In-glees.  He is an exile from his
people, a murderer.  We have Franquis and Espanyas,
Dakota and Shawnee, men of every tribe, including some
from beyond the Sky Mountains.  We have just raided a
Comanche village and run off their herd."
</p>

<p>
This statement created the sensation Tawannears intended
it should&mdash;for two reasons: the Comanches were enemies
no tribe despised, and the suggestion of unusual wealth in
horseflesh appealed to the special needs of the Tonkawa.
</p>

<p>
"That is well," answered the chief, with an evil smirk.
"We need horses.  We will come over, and take yours."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Tonkawas," he invited.  "My young men are
waiting for you behind the trees.  They will shoot you
down in the water, and those who reach the land will be
fresh meat for the axes of our women."
</p>

<p>
"You lie," said the Tonkawa.  "You are not so many
as we."
</p>

<p>
"There are thirty warriors behind those trees," asserted
Tawannears.  "How many of you would die before you had
their scalps&mdash;or before they fled?"
</p>

<p>
"We need horses," reiterated the chief.  "We are not
afraid to die.  We are warriors.  We are Tonkawa."
</p>

<p>
A murmur of savage approval, like the growl of a
wolf-pack, answered him from his men.
</p>

<p>
"That is good hearing," said Tawannears lightly.  "But
the Tonkawa do not think straight.  There is a cloud over
their eyes.  They say their medicine is weak."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"The Comanche are pursuing my people.  They will be
here soon, following the tracks of our horses.  If we are
here they will fight us.  If you drive us away and capture
the Comanches' horses, none the less will they attack you.
How many of the Tonkawa would be left, after fighting us,
to meet the Comanches?"
</p>

<p>
The Tonkawa pondered.
</p>

<p>
"We need horses," he said for the third time.  "Give
us what we require, and we will go away without
harming you."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears roared with laughter.
</p>

<p>
"They say the Tonkawa are men of blood," he answered,
wiping the tears from his eyes.  "But they are really men
who play with mirth."
</p>

<p>
A growl of muffled rage came from the Tonkawa band.
</p>

<p>
"Why should two wolf-packs attack each other when the
deer are thick on every side?" Tawannears continued.  "It
is as I say, the eyes of the Tonkawa are filled with the blood
from their wounds.  They cannot see straight.  They do not
understand that my people do not fear them.  Do you think
we should have ridden to meet you, giving warning of our
presence, if we had been in fear of you?  I tell you,
Tonkawas, you stand in more peril than we!"
</p>

<p>
This time there was no answering growl, and the Tonkawa
chief muttered briefly in council with several of his
older warriors.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you come here, then?" he asked bluffly.
</p>

<p>
"To trade," was Tawannears' prompt response.
</p>

<p>
"What?  We are not traders.  You can see we carry only
weapons.  We have been on a mission of vengeance."  His
voice swelled boastfully.  "The Kansas slew a small
hunting-party of our people many moons ago.  Three sleeps
back we burned their village, and filled our bellies with
their blood.  Their scalps hang on our lances."
</p>

<p>
It was true.  The Tonkawa lances were broidered from
midway of their shafts to the head with wisps of human
hair of all lengths.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears nodded tranquilly.
</p>

<p>
"That is well," he said.  "It is the fashion of my band
to slay all who cross our trail.  If we had not something else
in view we should slay you."
</p>

<p>
The Tonkawa leaned forward in his pad-saddle, jaw
menacing.
</p>

<p>
"Be careful or we test your boast!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"You dare not," returned Tawannears casually.
</p>

<p>
And by the very gentleness with which he said it he
carried conviction.  The Tonkawa looked from him to the
waving branches of the wood on the other side of the
stream.  It might conceal anything.  There were horses
grazing here and there, and at frequent intervals a figure
showed between the trunks, never for long enough to
supply opportunity for identification.
</p>

<p>
"You say you come to trade," objected the Tonkawa.
"I have told you we have nothing to trade&mdash;except scalps."
</p>

<p>
He grinned the insinuation that we were the kind of
warriors who were careless how we added to our tale of
trophies.  Tawannears ignored the gibe.
</p>

<p>
"Yet you have that which we require," replied the
Seneca.
</p>

<p>
He pointed to the full quivers that hung at every
warrior's back.
</p>

<p>
"Ho!" laughed the Tonkawa.  "So you are weaponless!"
</p>

<p>
"It is true," answered Tawannears as gently as he had
spoken before, "that we have shot away most of our arrows,
but we have sufficient to account for you.  Will you try us?"
</p>

<p>
"Why should we believe you?" derided the chief.  "Do
the Tonkawa trade like the Comanches?"
</p>

<p>
"What we seek is means to trade better with the
Comanches," retorted Tawannears, a shaft which drew grim
chuckles from his hearers.
</p>

<p>
The Tonkawa, for all their debased habits and uncouth
manners, possessed the marked sense of humor which all
Indians enjoy.
</p>

<p>
"How many horses will you trade?" asked the chief.
</p>

<p>
"How many do you need?" countered Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
The chief surveyed the depleted ranks of his band, and
held up his ten fingers and thumbs twice&mdash;twenty.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"That is too many.  We do not require enough arrows
to pay for them.  You would have to empty every quiver."
</p>

<p>
"You can trade us so many or we will come and take
them," threatened the chief.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears started to knee his horse around to return
across the river.
</p>

<p>
"Wait!" called the Tonkawa.  "We will give other weapons."
</p>

<p>
This was more than Tawannears really had expected&mdash;as
he later admitted&mdash;to maneuver the other side into enlarging
the scope of the trade.  He went through the form of a
consultation with me, and then asked:
</p>

<p>
"The Tonkawa make fine weapons.  That is said everywhere.
What will you give for twenty horses?"
</p>

<p>
"Six quivers of arrows, two bows and a leather cuirass
for yourself."
</p>

<p>
"It is not enough."  Tawannears rejected the offer
decidedly.  "With six quivers you must give six bows&mdash;and we
will take four cuirasses and ten knives and hatchets."
</p>

<p>
The Tonkawa scowled furiously.
</p>

<p>
"Would you leave us weaponless, too?" he howled.  "We
will first come and take what we require!"
</p>

<p>
I thought he was in earnest now, but when Tawannears
repeated his play of breaking off negotiations, it had the
same effect as the first time; and the upshot of it all was
that we agreed to accept six quivers, four bows, two
cuirasses, and ten knives and eight hatchets.  This was
more than we needed, of course, but we had to ask for so
much to carry out the pretense of our numbers.
</p>

<p>
After the terms of the trading had been arranged we
came to the question of the means of putting the deal into
effect.  The Tonkawa chief wanted us to drive the horses
over to his side of the river&mdash;having first suggested that
his band come across and receive their new mounts at the
edge of the wood, in order to save us trouble!&mdash;and receive
the weapons there.  But Tawannears finally engaged him
to the stipulation that the trade was to be completed in
midstream, betwixt four persons on a side, the others of
both sides, as he put it, to retire out of arrow-shot from
the banks.
</p>

<p>
This much accomplished we returned to our friends,
rounded up twenty head and brought them to the margin
of the bank, Kachina and Peter helping us to handle the
herd.  The Tonkawa had observed the terms of the agreement,
in so far as the retirement of the main body a long
bow-shot from the bank; but the four waiting at the water's
edge, with the complement of arms, all carried their own
weapons, and there was some delay whilst Tawannears rode
forward and demanded that they throw down everything,
except the goods intended for us.
</p>

<p>
This created a delay, and Kachina drew my attention to
the sudden darkening of the western sky.  The day had
been murkily close, with a sweating heat.  Now the sun was
obscured by a haze, and in the west a rampart of leaden-black
clouds was heaping above the horizon, lapping over
like a series of gigantic waves that tumbled and struggled
amongst themselves, lashing out convulsively in long, inky
streamers.  The air was soggy.  Not a breath was stirring.
</p>

<p>
"A storm is coming," she said.  "We must be quick."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I agreed, "but we cannot take chances with these
people.  They are treacherous."
</p>

<p>
"The storm will be worse than the Tonkawa," she
affirmed, shrugging her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
I did not believe her, nor did I give a second thought to
what she had said.  My attention was confined to the four
warriors with whom Tawannears was arguing, and I
attached far more importance to what they did than to the
approaching storm.  As a matter of fact, I was correct in
my suspicions, for subsequent events proved that they were
meditating a surprise assault upon us, planning to stampede
the horses to their side of the stream, and relying upon
flight to save them from the friends they still supposed us
to have concealed in the wood.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears spoke forcibly to the Tonkawa chief, who
was one of the four representatives of his side, and as Peter
and I began to drive the horses back toward the wood, he
yielded.  The four, accompanied by Tawannears, rode into
the current, the trade-weapons wrapped in three bundles,
one carried by each of the chief's assistants.  We turned
the horses with some difficulty and met them half-way.
The chief, I think, smelt a rat as soon as he realized Kachina
to be a woman.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Wah!</i>" he grunted.  "Cannot you send warriors to
meet warriors?"
</p>

<p>
"The women who go with our band fight with our band,"
returned Tawannears coolly.  "They sit with the warriors."
</p>

<p>
The Tonkawa eyed the wood behind us, and it must have
occurred to him that no other figures were in view.  But if
he considered taking the offensive at that juncture, he
abandoned the idea when Peter rode up beside him and
clamped huge paws on two of the bundles of weapons.  I
took the third bundle and passed it to Kachina, intending
to keep my hands free for whatever might happen.  But
the Tonkawa evidently decided to run no unnecessary risks.
He and his men skilfully packed the twenty horses together
and herded them toward the northern bank.  We, on our
part, headed south.
</p>

<p>
We had not reached the shore, when we heard the racket
of hoofs and looked back to see the remainder of the
Tonkawa streaming down to the bank, the weariest of their
mounts flogged to the gallop, lances brandished overhead.
Their chief, weaponless as he was, never stopped to retrieve
his arms from the northern bank, but put himself at the
head of his warriors as they stormed into the water.
Splashing, yelling, whooping, they shoved our herd before
them, those with failing ponies dropping off in the shallows
to mount bare-backed the first fresh horse they could catch.
</p>

<p>
"Run, brothers!" said Tawannears curtly.
</p>

<p>
With a blind thought for some such emergency, I had
picked for our mounts Sunkawakan-kedeshka and three of
his mares.  The stallion loved to run; his favorites, I knew,
would exert every energy to keep up with him.  The four
fairly flew up the bank and out upon the prairie.  We
were a long mile in the lead when the first of the Tonkawas
straggled into sight.  They would capture the rest of the
herd in the wood, but we could not help that.  Our one
purpose was to place as much distance as possible betwixt
us and that demon throng.
</p>

<p>
It grew darker and darker.  The afternoon was well
advanced, but sunset came late these Summer days.  The
gloom was unnatural.  Objects showed distinctly in the
gray light, and behind us was formed a strangely vivid
picture&mdash;a belt of open grass; then the low-lying figures
of our pursuers, their ponies stretching to the furious pace;
then the green bulwark of the trees; and over all the dense,
smoky-black canopy of the storm-clouds, arching nearer
and nearer.  The sun was blanketed completely.  The last
patch of blue sky dwindled away in the east.  A low
moaning sound made me wonder if the shouts of the Tonkawa
could carry so far.  Kachina turned in her saddle and
pointed.
</p>

<p>
"Look!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
We obeyed her.  The Tonkawa had stayed their pursuit.
They were yanking their horses to a halt.  Some of them
already were heading back toward the wood.  The moaning
sound grew louder.  The cloud-curtain in the West stretched
now from the prairie's floor to the sky's zenith, sootily
impenetrable.
</p>

<p>
"They fear the storm!" cried Kachina.
</p>

<p>
"It will be very wet," assented Tawannears.  "We must
wrap up our new bows."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you there is no need to think of bows," she
exclaimed with passionate eagerness.  "You have never seen
one of these storms or you would know how grave is our
peril.  The wind blows the grass out of the ground.  If it
catches us in the open we shall be blown over&mdash;horses and
all.  I have seen them in the valley at Homolobi, and out
here it will be worse, much worse!"
</p>

<p>
"What are we to do?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"We must have shelter."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears and I both laughed.
</p>

<p>
"The only shelter is in the wood we left," I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"We are fortunate to be out of it," she declared.  "Trees
blow over.  No, we must find a hole, a depression in the
ground, anything&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Dis way," interrupted Peter calmly.
</p>

<p>
He turned his horse clumsily to the left and led us down
the steep bank of a miniature rivulet, a tributary of the
river beside which we had been camping.  Under the bank
we were out of sight of people on the prairie, and at least
partially protected from the storm.  At Tawannears'
suggestion, we wrapped our new weapons in our clothing&mdash;what
the Comanches had left us&mdash;and stowed them in a hole
in the bank.  Then, having done all that we could, we sat
close together on the ground, holding the horses' rawhide
bridles.
</p>

<p>
The moaning had increased to a dull, vibrating roar,
muffled and vague.  Jagged splashes of lightning streaked
the sky.  The air had become chilly cold, and we shivered
for want of the clothes we had put aside.  There was a
peculiar tension in the atmosphere.  The horses sensed it.
They stamped nervously, jerked around at unexpected
noises.  The stallion whinnied at me, asking reassurance,
and I stroked his muzzle.
</p>

<p>
"It is long coming," said Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Kachina, "and when it is here we shall
be fortunate if we can breathe."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, the moaning roar became a deafening scream;
the blackness mantled the earth like a garment, and we,
huddled close to the ground, felt the shock of a great arm
sweeping just above our heads.  It was the wind.  There
was no rain, but a shower of objects began to fall against
the opposite wall of the gulch.  Shapes, indistinct in the
mirk, crashed formless into the bed of the rivulet.  The
horses were frantic.  The stallion snatched back as something
sailed past him, and pulled me to my feet.  I felt as
though a giant's hand had clutched my neck.  I began to
lift into the air, and knew I was being sucked up.  The
stallion broke free from me, but I still continued to rise.
Then I was violently clutched by the ankles and hauled
down to earth.
</p>

<p>
Peter dragged me against the bank beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Stay down!" he bellowed in my ear.  "Der windt
plows you away."
</p>

<p>
"But the stallion!"
</p>

<p>
"All der horses are gone.  Idt cannot be helped."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br><br>
MY ORENDA SAVES US
</h3>

<p>
A lightning-bolt exploded with a crash, and a
cold, purple radiance briefly illuminated our
surroundings.  The air was filled with trees, wisps of
grass, clods of earth.  The distorted bodies of a man and a
horse lay against the opposite bank of the depression&mdash;'twas
they, doubtless, had stampeded our mounts.  Apparently
they had been hurled there by some caprice of the
wind.  I had a vision, too, of the strained faces of my
comrades&mdash;Peter's little eyes very wide, Kachina's hair all
tumbled about her face, Tawannears grimly watchful.
Then darkness again, and the steady, monotonous roar of
the wind, no thing of puffs or gusts, but a stupendous,
overpowering blast of sheer strength that no living being
could stand up to.
</p>

<p>
It was tricky and sly, ruthless and resourceful.  It
dropped pebbles and earth-clods on us.  It eddied in the
depression and created whirlpools which snatched at us
lustfully.  And once there was a thud overhead and a
crumbling of the bank&mdash;and a large tree rolled down upon
us, the butt of the trunk missing Kachina by a
hand's-breadth.  But this last attack was really a blessing in
disguise, for presently the rain came, and when the wind
let up we were able to prop the tree against the bank, and
it furnished some slight shelter, stripped though it was
of leaves.
</p>

<p>
The rain was almost more terrible than the wind.  For
a while, indeed, the wind continued undiminished, lashing
us with slanting columns of water that struck like liquid
lances, the drops spurting up half a man's stature from the
ground after the impact.  Then, as the wind dropped, the
rain came down perpendicularly, whipping our naked
bodies with icy rods.  A chill permeated the air.  We were
so cold that our teeth chattered.  And the cold and the rain
and the darkness continued, hour after hour.
</p>

<p>
How long it lasted I do not know, but I remember noting
the lessening of the downpour, its swishing away in the
East and the frosty twinkling of the stars.  We were all too
exhausted to think of anything except rest and we cowered
beneath the tree-trunk, huddling close for warmth, and
somehow slept.  When we awoke the sun was rising, and the
air was fresh and clear.  The sky was cloudless and a soft
blue.  But all around us was strewn the wreckage of the
storm.
</p>

<p>
The bodies of the man and horse the lightning-flash had
revealed in the night still lay in two heaps of broken bones
and pounded flesh.  Three other horses, battered beyond
recognition, were scattered along the bank of the shallow
ravine or river-bed.  Peering over the top of the bank we
discovered that broad patches of the prairie had been
denuded of grass, the underlying earth gouged up as though
with a plough.  The grove in which we had hidden was
hacked and torn, an open swath cut through it, many trees
down, all more or less mutilated.
</p>

<p>
Of the Tonkawas there was not a trace.  Whatever
casualties they had endured, plainly they had fled from so
unlucky a spot; and that they had suffered by the storm we
were convinced by ascertaining that the dead man the wind
had blown into our hiding-place wore the hide cuirass which
distinguished these raiders.  Probably they had continued
upon their way south as soon as the rain abated sufficiently.
</p>

<p>
Our horses had vanished with equal completeness.  The
rain had washed out hoof-prints, and we had no means of
tracking them.  And I have often reflected upon the oddity
of circumstance in twice throwing the spotted stallion in my
path, only to separate us without warning after he had
fulfilled his mission.  I hope that Sunkawakan-kedeshka
and his mares escaped the storm, and that he lived out his
life, free and untamed, leading his herd upon the prairies.
But I do not know.  Destiny had its use for him.  He served
his dumb turn&mdash;and passed on.
</p>

<p>
Yet I like to think&mdash;and it may be I have imbibed
somewhat of the red man's pagan philosophy from over-much
dwelling in his society&mdash;that in this shadowy after-world of
spirits, in which both red man and white profess belief, man
shall find awaiting him the brave beasts that loved him on
earth.  There I may ride through the fields of asphodels,
gripping between my knees the spirit-form of that which
was Sunkawakan-kedeshka, feeling again the throb and
strain of willing muscles, curbing the patient, tireless
energy as I used to, watching the velvet ear that ever
switched back for a kind word or drooped at a rebuke.
But I dream&mdash;as old men must.
</p>

<p>
Consider now our plight.  We who had been lately so
harried by fate were once more exposed to its whimsies.
But recently prisoners, next free but weaponless, we were
today at liberty and armed, but the horses upon which we
had relied to expedite our passage of the plains were gone.
Also, we required food for we had not eaten since noon of
the day previous.  Our nakedness I do not emphasize
because Tawannears was an Indian and accustomed to it,
and Peter and I had been habituated to it by years of
exposure.  For Kachina we had saved enough clothing to
cover her, although she resented the distinction, and was
as ready to bear her share of hardship as any of us.
</p>

<p>
Our food problem was solved temporarily by Peter, who
insisted, and proved to our satisfaction that the flesh of the
horses killed by the storm was still perfectly good.  We ate
it without avidity, tough, stringy meat, and sodden with
moisture, but it sustained us for new efforts.
</p>

<p>
Having unburied our cache of weapons, we examined
them carefully and were able to equip ourselves anew, Peter
carrying the two extra quivers of arrows at his own
insistence.  The two hide cuirasses, cumbrous garments of the
thick neck-hide of the buffalo slowly dried by fire, we
discarded as being too hot and confining and stinking of their
former wearers.  We likewise threw into the bed of the
rivulet those knives and tomahawks for which we had no
use, retaining four of each, of very fine Spanish steel,
which the Tonkawas must have traded or ravaged from the
Apache or other Southern tribes.
</p>

<p>
We were none of us disposed to continue eating horse-meat
and we were all anxious to get as far as possible from
a country which had been so singularly prolific in
misfortune for us.  So as soon as we had tested our bows and
drunk deep of the brown stream that foamed along the
gulch, we set out northeastward, aiming to work back to the
river we had been following ever since we quit the Eastern
skirts of the Sky Mountains.  We were governed in adopting
this course by the same reasons which had influenced
us before: we were afraid to venture away from water,
we were more likely to find game near a river, and finally,
it served as a guide to us in threading this pathless
territory.  To be sure, as we had proved already, there was more
danger of meeting savages adjacent to a considerable river;
but that was a risk we had to take.  We were resolved to be
doubly vigilant after our experiences with the Comanches
and Tonkawas.
</p>

<p>
For three days we paralleled the river, pitching our
course several miles to the south of it and approaching its
banks only when we were driven to do so by need of water.
During this time we fed on hares and a small animal which
lived in multitudes in burrows under the prairies, besides
a few fish which Tawannears caught in the river, employing
a bone-hook he fashioned himself and a string of rawhide
from Kachina's shirt.  We saw no other men or large
animals, and the country gave every indication of having
been swept bare by the storm.
</p>

<p>
On the fourth day we began to sight buffalo, and supped
to satisfaction on the luscious hump of a young cow
Tawannears shot, overjoyed at this welcome change in our diet.
But the buffalo were the cause of our undoing.  The small
scattered herds that we first met were the usual advance-guards
of an enormous army, grazing its way northward,
and in order not to be delayed by its slow progress we
crossed the river to the North bank and hurried east,
intending to loop the front of the main herd.  This we
succeeded in doing, and then decided to remain on that side
of the river, inasmuch as we knew we must be far south
of the point at which we sought to strike the Mississippi,
and ought really to be heading rather north of east.
</p>

<p>
'Twas this move which brought fresh trouble upon us,
albeit conducing in the long run to our salvation.  Had we
remained on the south bank, we might have run the gauntlet
of enemies by other means, but this story must have been
shaped differently&mdash;additional evidence of the immutable
determination of Destiny to govern the issue of our lives.
And had we not been blinded by our desire for haste and
the isolation we had found in the track of the storm we
should have realized that the approach of so large a herd
would be a bait for the first tribe whose scouts marked it
down.  But we were blinded&mdash;by accident or Destiny,
as you please.
</p>

<p>
As I have said, we pushed on north of the river, adhering
to our former plan of keeping out of sight of its channel,
and scouting carefully the ground ahead.  We never gave
a thought to what was behind us, and were paralyzed when
Kachina, idly surveying the country from the summit of
one of the long, easy swells which broke the monotony of
the level plains, caught Tawannears by the arm and pointed
westward, too surprised for words, fear and amazement
struggling in her face.
</p>

<p>
It was the middle of the forenoon, a warm, bright
Summer day, yet not warm enough to bring up the dancing
heat-haze which played strange tricks with vision in these
vast open spaces.  The next swell behind us was some two
or three miles distant, and over its crest were galloping a
string of tiny figures&mdash;horsemen with waving lances and
glaring white shields.  We were as distinct to them as they
were to us, and the fact that they gave no special sign of
exultation at seeing us was proof sufficient that they had
been following us for some time.  They were trailing us,
scores of them, ay, hundreds, as they poured over the crest
of the swell in a colorful, barbaric stream of martial
vigor&mdash;and they could travel three feet to our one.  Of course,
they had picked up our trail in riding down to the river
to meet the buffalo herd, and had followed it with the
insatiable curiosity and rapacious instinct of their race.
</p>

<p>
So much we reasoned in the first second of discovery.
We wasted no time in conversation, but dodged below the
crest of the swell and ran at top-speed for the river as
offering the nearest available cover under its banks.  But the
wily savages behind us divined our plan, and when, after
we had traveled a mile, Tawannears reconnoitered their
positions, it was to learn that they had detached a troop to
ride diagonally up the slope of the swell and so cut us off
from our goal.  Two hundred of them were abreast of us
at that moment less than a mile away.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears halted.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis useless," he said brusquely.  "We shall wind ourselves
to no purpose.  All that is left for us is to sell our
lives dearly."
</p>

<p>
He turned his face skyward and appealed to his gods
as a warrior and an equal.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Hawenneyu," he exclaimed, "and you, too, of the
Honochenokeh, have you permitted Tawannears to escape
all these perils, to obtain his Lost Soul, and abandoned him
at the end to Hanegoategeh?  See, Tawannears calls upon
you for aid.  And upon you of the Deohako, Three Sisters
of Sustenance, Our Supporters!  Tawannears calls upon
you by right.
</p>

<p>
"Will you desert him when he has toiled and suffered so?
Will you desert his white brothers who have been loyal
through dangers no men ever dared before?  Will you
desert the Lost Soul who has been true to him in death, who
returns with him from the land beyond the sunset, she who
has traversed the Halls of Haniskaonogeh, the Dwelling-place
of Evil, she who has passed with us through the lodge
of Gaoh, lord of the winds, she who has defied Hanegoategeh?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Tharon the Sky-holder, Tawannears calls upon you
to uphold him!  But if death must come, then, oh, Hawenneyu,
let Tawannears and his Lost Soul die together!  Let
the white brothers go with us to the Halls of the Honochenokeh!
Let us take with us the spirits of many warriors!
Grant us a good death, oh, Hawenneyu!"
</p>

<p>
I am a Christian, but I thrilled to that prayer, and I
called out&mdash;"<i>Yo-hay!</i>" after the manner of the People of
the Long House.
</p>

<p>
Kachina notched an arrow, and loosed it into the air.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever the gods say, we fight!" she said.  "We fight
where the arrow falls."
</p>

<p>
It quivered into the sod a hundred yards in front of us
just under the crest of the swell.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>, dot's as goodt a place as any," Peter agreed equably.
"Andt now we fight, eh?"
</p>

<p>
We trotted up to the arrow and clustered around it as
the flanking party of the attackers galloped over the crest
between us and the river.  They whooped their delight upon
seeing they had headed us, and a warrior commenced to
ride his pony in furious circles to signal the main body they
had us at bay, whilst the rest raced back to engage us.  In
five minutes they had strung a ring and were drawing in
closer and closer toward bowshot distance.
</p>

<p>
Of all the tribes we had seen these men were the handsomest
and most imposing.  Tall, broad-shouldered, their
bronze bodies shining with grease, they sat their
pad-saddles, stirrupless, as though they were part of the horses
under them.  Their heads were shaven, except for a narrow
ridge from forehead to scalplock, which was stiffened with
paint and grease until it stood erect in semblance of a horn.
Their faces were fierce, but intelligent.  They proved their
reckless valor by the way they overwhelmed us.
</p>

<p>
As bowmen they had no rivals.  We opened upon them as
soon as we thought we had a faint chance of driving a
shaft or two home; but they, clinging to their horses,
shooting sometimes from the opposite sides or even from under
their bellies, encumbered, too, with lance and shield, were
able to send in shaft for shaft, which we avoided only
by rapidly shifting our ground.  We saw at once that in
an arrow-duel we stood no chance, and as they did not seem
anxious to force conclusions immediately, at Tawannears'
suggestion we suspended our fire.  They promptly desisted
from their attack, their restless circle hovering round and
round us, ready to smother any attempt at escape.
</p>

<p>
"Why do they wait?" cried Kachina.  "They surely
do not fear us!"
</p>

<p>
"Not they!" retorted Tawannears.  "These people are
great warriors."
</p>

<p>
"Who are they?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears never saw them before, brother."
</p>

<p>
"Here comes der chief," spoke up Peter.
</p>

<p>
With hundreds of deep voices chanting rhythmically, a
mighty cavalcade came slowly over the summit of the swell,
rank on rank of horsemen, the sunlight glinting on the
white or painted surfaces of their shields, a forest of
feathered lances standing above the horn-like headdresses.
Leading them all was a warrior taller than the tallest, his
chest arched like a demi-cask, the muscles playing on his
huge shoulders as he controlled his mettlesome white horse.
His face was as gravely handsome as Tawannears'; with a
high forehead and a jutting, beaked nose; but his eyes were
the fierce, watchful eyes of a savage, and his mouth was
a cruel, thin line.
</p>

<p>
"A t'ousandt men!" gasped Peter.
</p>

<p>
The warriors in the circle around us reined in their
horses, tossed their lances aloft and joined their voices in
the booming chant of their brethren.  Two of them quirted
out of the line and raced up to the chief on the white horse
to report.  We could see their animated gestures, the
frequency with which they pointed at us.  The chief raised
his hand, the chant was stilled, and he rode through the
circle, attended by the two messengers, or sub-chiefs, and
halted within hail of us.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears strode forward to meet him, and I marveled
at the assurance the Seneca conveyed in his attitude.  It
was as if he were backed by the whole force of the keepers
of the Western Door.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" he demanded in the tone of one who
holds power, speaking in the same mingled dialect of
Comanche and Dakota he had used with the Tonkawas.
</p>

<p>
The chief on the white horse was manifestly amazed at
Tawannears' assurance, but he replied quietly in the same
tongue:
</p>

<p>
"They say I am Awa, war-chief of the Chahiksichahiks.*
Who are you who walk on the ground with white men?"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Men-of-men, the real name of the Pawnee, the latter name,
meaning Horn-wearers, being their designation by other tribes.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"They call me Tawannears, warden of the Western Door
of the Long House, war-chief of the Hodenosaunee,"
Tawannears shot back.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears is many moons' journey from his teepee,"
rejoined Awa.  "He did not come to our village and ask
permission to cross our country."
</p>

<p>
"Why should a chief of the Long House ask permission
to go on the Great Spirit's business?" returned
Tawannears.  "We have done your people no harm."
</p>

<p>
"If that is so," said the chief on the white horse,
"render up to my people the maiden who is with you, and you
may go free."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Tawannears, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"Every Summer Tirawa, the Old One in the Sky, sends
my people a maid for a sacrifice.  They say the maid with
you comes to die on the scaffold under the morning star."
</p>

<p>
"They say lies," answered Tawannears with passion.
"You shall not have her alive.  She is holy."
</p>

<p>
Awa's reply was a gesture with his hand and a shouted
order in his own language.  A hundred warriors slipped
from their horses in the first rank of the array outside the
circle, dropped lances, shields and bows and ran toward us.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears, his face a mask of fury, ripped an arrow
from his quiver and drove it at Awa's chest; but the chief
on the white horse calmly interposed his shield and stopped
it neatly, and the charge of warriors on foot compelled
the Seneca to run back to us.  We, who had understood
practically nothing of the dialogue which had passed,
were uncertain what the situation meant.  Tawannears,
himself, was at a loss.
</p>

<p>
"Fight," he shouted hoarsely.  "We must not be captured."
</p>

<p>
We loosed arrows as rapidly as we could draw from
quivers and notch them.  'Twas impossible to miss at that
point-blank range, and we killed a dozen men before
they came to hand-grips.  Then we used knife and hatchet,
Kachina as remorselessly as the rest of us, our assailants,
evidently under Awa's orders, scrupulously refraining
from drawing a weapon, lest they harm the girl who was
destined for the sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Back to back, striving to protect Kachina, we fought
like wolves in famine-time, our arms aching from slaughter,
but the Pawnee would not give in.  They dived betwixt the
legs of their comrades who were grappling barehanded
against our knives, and so pulled us down.  Peter was last
to go, a dozen men clinging to his limbs.  Kachina, biting
at her captors, was led struggling from the heap of bodies.
We others were jerked to our feet, arms pinioned and
dragged after her.
</p>

<p>
The Pawnee horsemen crowded around us and the men
we had killed.  The chief on the white horse stared with
satisfaction at Kachina's lithe body, hardly covered by the
rags of her garments, and grinned amusement when she
spat at him, trying to plant her teeth in the arm of one of
the men who restrained her.  He turned from her to the
panting, bleeding warriors who held us, and to the pile
of dead around the arrow Kachina had shot into the air.
It stood there yet, hub of an ill-omened wheel of corpses,
its feathers ruffling in the breeze.  It seemed to fascinate
him.  His grin became a frown.
</p>

<p>
"You have made me pay a price for the girl," he said
to Tawannears.  "That is well.  The Pawnee are not afraid
to pay what Tirawa asks.  But you shall pay now a price
to me."
</p>

<p>
He drew his own bow from its case, and selected a shaft
from the quiver at his side, notched it and aimed it at my
chest.
</p>

<p>
"Awa will shoot you, one by one," he announced.
"Afterward your hearts shall be cut out, and we will
make strong medicine with them.  This white man shall
die first."
</p>

<p>
I had no more than time to smile at Tawannears and
Peter when he pulled the bow-string taut and loosed.
I had braced myself for the shock, knowing the shaft at
that range must go clean through me.  And certes, the blow
was all that I had expected.  I staggered before it.  Had
it not been for the warriors who held my arms I must
have fallen backward.
</p>

<p>
Involuntarily I had shut my eyes.  I opened them again,
expecting to be in another world, marveling that the pain
of an arrow in my vitals was no worse than a smart rap
upon the chest.  Around me I heard a gusty sigh, the
sound made by many people expelling their breath.  I
looked down, wondering if I could still see myself, if the
blood would be spurting or trickling.
</p>

<p>
But I could find no wound.  There was no arrow, no
mark, no blood.  I felt the savage holding my left arm
sag strangely and turned to him.  His face was gray, his
eyes glazing.  The arrow which had struck me was
projecting from his side, buried half-way to the head.  He
collapsed as I looked at him.
</p>

<p>
There was an audible gasp from the ranks of horsemen.
I found Awa's face in the throng, and noted that it was
almost as ashen as that of the dying man beside me.  The
chief held the bow stiffly in his left band, right arm crooked
as when he had loosed.
</p>

<p>
Tawannears laughed harshly.
</p>

<p>
"Strong medicine Awa has made!" he mocked.  "He
shot at my white brother an arm's-length away, and my
brother turned the arrow against the great chief's warrior.
Will Awa try again?  Shall we make more medicine for
him?"
</p>

<p>
Awa's arm was trembling as he returned the bow to
its case.
</p>

<p>
"Your white brother has strong medicine," he admitted.
"We will carry you all to our village, and our medicine-men
shall try their magic upon you.  Awa is a war-chief,
not a maker of magic."
</p>

<p>
"We are both warriors and medicine-men!" Tawannears
derided him mercilessly.  "Shall we make trial of
our medicine again?"
</p>

<p>
Awa abruptly reined his horse about, shouted an order
and clattered off at the head of his cavalcade.  Our guards
first bound our arms loosely behind us, then tied strips of
rawhide betwixt us and themselves, one on either side, and
mounted us upon ponies.  Thus each of us was tied to
a pair of the Pawnee.
</p>

<p>
I called to Tawannears as he was led by me.
</p>

<p>
"What happened?  My eyes were shut.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Your Orenda is powerful, brother," he replied
seriously.  "It has spread its hand over our heads.
Hawenneyu has used it to answer the prayer of Tawannears."
</p>

<p>
I was no less puzzled by this, but Peter cackled shrilly.
</p>

<p>
"Look adt your chest," he squeaked.
</p>

<p>
I bent my head.  My chest was bare, unscarred.  All it
showed was the little deerskin pouch Guanaea had hung
around my neck by a thong the day we left Deonundagaa,
which had stayed by me through all our adventures.  No
Indian would have dreamed of taking it from me, for it
contained my medicine, and the possibilities for evil
inherent in interference with another man's medicine were
boundless.
</p>

<p>
I regarded the pouch idly, my mind occupied with the
thought that it was practically the only possession with
which I had started upon our journey that was still with
me&mdash;and I was startled to see a slit in its front.  I looked
at it more closely.  Yes, there was a slit, such a slit as
an arrow-head might make.
</p>

<p>
What had Tawannears said?
</p>

<p>
"Your Orenda is powerful, brother."
</p>

<p>
And what had Guanaea said in hanging it there?
</p>

<p>
"That will protect you against all evils!  A most powerful
Orenda!  I had it made by Hineogetah, the Medicine
Man."
</p>

<p>
But that was ridiculous, I told myself!  I had worn it
to please Guanaea, and because her forethought had touched
me.  But was that a reason for subscribing to gross
superstition?  This fetched me around to my starting-point.
The fact remained that the bag had stopped an arrow.
How?  My mind cast back for further aid, and memory
came to my rescue.
</p>

<p>
What had it contained?
</p>

<p>
"The fangs of a bull rattlesnake.  That is the spirit
to resist evil.  The eye-tooth of a wolf.  That is the spirit
to resist courage."
</p>

<p>
The eye-tooth of a wolf!  That had done it.  I wiggled
my chest-muscles and felt the protuberance under the
draw-string&mdash;and beneath it a certain soreness.  The arrow
had driven head-on into the tooth and been diverted
sideways into the warrior on my left.  So mysterious as this
are the wonders of Providence&mdash;or Destiny&mdash;or an
Iroquois medicine man?

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
A PROPHET IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
</h3>

<p>
During the afternoon of the fifth day of hard
riding our guards fetched us from the midst of the
column to a position next to Awa.  The chief had
recovered somewhat from his bedazed wonder&mdash;no doubt
he had half-expected me to continue working
miracles&mdash;and regarded us with saturnine satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"Soon we shall enter the villages of our people," he
announced, swinging his arm toward the prairie in front of
us.  "The medicine-men of the Chahiksichahiks then will
make trial of the white man's medicine&mdash;and we will build
a scaffold for the red maiden to lie upon when she weds
the morning star."
</p>

<p>
"That is to be seen," returned Tawannears with
undisturbed arrogance.  "A voice has whispered in my ear
that the Great Spirit has other plans.  It says there will
be misfortune for the Horn-wearers if the red maiden is
sacrificed."
</p>

<p>
Awa scowled.
</p>

<p>
"We shall see," he agreed.
</p>

<p>
Feathered lances bobbing overhead, our great escort of
savage horsemen cantered out of a shallow gulley onto the
bank of a sizeable river.  A mile or so east and well back
from high-water mark began a series of low, hump-backed
mounds, which I took to be natural features of the terrain.
But as we came nearer people popped out of them, and we
perceived that they were houses, partly dug out of the
ground and roofed and walled with sods, commodious
dwellings, larger than the largest of teepees and invariably
round in shape.
</p>

<p>
The people who met us were old men and women, with
an occasional young child of toddling age or under.  Awa
barked a question to the first group, and one of the old men
quavered an answer, gesturing down-river, where the
sod-covered earth-houses reached as far as we could see.  With
a nod of acknowledgment, the chief heeled his horse to a
gallop, and we rode on at speed along a rough trail that
led betwixt houses and river-bank.  Beyond the houses
were simple gardens, and in rear of these horses grazed.
Dogs ran out of many houses and barked at us.  But
nowhere did we see a man or woman in the prime of life
or a half-grown child.
</p>

<p>
The mystery of the deserted village&mdash;or, rather, succession
of villages&mdash;was settled after we had ridden another
three miles, when an enormous crowd of savages appeared
in an open space in the center of the largest collection of
earth-houses.  There must have been ten or twelve
thousand people clustered together, men, women and children,
all deeply interested in some proceeding which we could
not see at first.  But the thudding of the hoofs of Awa's
band attracted their attention, and they opened their ranks
for us, so that our column passed through the outskirts
of the throng and came to a halt on the verge of a circle
of hard-trodden clay, perhaps a hundred feet across.
</p>

<p>
In the center of this space stood a fire-charred stump
of wood, and lashed to it with strips of green hide was the
black-garbed figure of a man whose dead-white face
brought a gasp of astonishment from my lips.  'Twas Black
Robe, Père Hyacinthe, the Jesuit, whom we had last seen
the day he insisted upon leaving us on the western bank of
the Mississippi, striding alone into the unknown wastes
ahead!
</p>

<p>
His ankles were hobbled loosely and bound to the base of
the stump.  His hands, knotted behind his back, were
likewise fastened to it.  He could move a foot or so in
either direction, and six feet away from him a party
of warriors were building a pile of light-wood, which had
reached the height of his knees when our arrival distracted
them from their labors.
</p>

<p>
His soutane was the same rusty, torn garment he had
worn three years before.  His sandals were patched and
worn.  His gaunt figure testified, as always, to the ceaseless
toil and deprivation to which he subjected himself.  His
emaciated features shone with the radiation of some inward
light, and his face, with eyes closed, was upturned in
prayer.  Certes, no man could have been in worse case,
yet his racked body contrived to express an ecstasy of
joy beyond all words.  Indeed, his utter lack of fear, the
otherworldliness of his devotion, had already sapped the
savage energy of his would-be tormentors.  They were not
used to seeing a man face the prospect of torture without
boasting or exultation, with no more than the calm
disdain of a courage higher than any emotion they knew.
</p>

<p>
I was not alone in my surprise.  Tawannears clicked
his tongue.  Peter muttered&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Der Jesuit!"
</p>

<p>
Kachina remarked with interest&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Another white man!"
</p>

<p>
And Awa was as dumfounded as ourselves.  He shouted
a question, and a knot of gorgeously-decorated chiefs and
medicine-men detached themselves from the front rank of
the onlookers and clustered about his horse, pointing at
us, their eyes fairly popping from their heads.  Evidently,
they, too, were surprised&mdash;and that was not strange, for
'twas seldom these wild horsemen of the plains saw three
white men at once, or so I reasoned.
</p>

<p>
"The Great Spirit's ways are difficult to follow,"
commented Tawannears.  "He has carried us again along
Black Robe's trail."
</p>

<p>
"Awa will see in his capture an excuse for daring to
disregard my Orenda," I said pessimistically.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nein, nein,</i>" squeaked Corlaer.  "All is not well wit'
der Pawnee.  See how dey boggle andt chaw togedder."
</p>

<p>
'Twas so.  Awa's face was a mingling of baffled rage,
hysterical superstition and credulous awe.  His gaze shifted
rapidly from us to the figure of Black Robe, eyes still closed,
lips murmuring in silent prayer.  The medicine-men and
chiefs who had swarmed up to the war-chief were staring
at us with expressions akin to fear.  Awa suddenly spat
out an ejaculation, and pushed his horse beside us.  We
four were now the focal object of the crowd's attention.
</p>

<p>
"Whence did you say you have come?" he demanded
of Tawannears in the polyglot trade dialect.
</p>

<p>
"From beyond the setting sun," Tawannears replied
gravely.  "I have been to the Land of Lost Souls, and
there I found this maiden who loved me once before on
earth and is come back with me to reënter my lodge."
</p>

<p>
"But this Taivo, this white man?"  Awa leveled his
finger at me.
</p>

<p>
"He, too, has come with me from the land beyond the
sunset."
</p>

<p>
Awa spoke rapidly in the Pawnee tongue, and one of
the medicine-men, a brightly painted, elderly man with
wrinkled face, took up the conversation in Comanche.
</p>

<p>
"It was foretold by the white man at the stake that you
would come," he began.
</p>

<p>
"That is likely," admitted Tawannears, unperturbed.
</p>

<p>
"He told us," continued the medicine-man, with a fearful
look over his shoulder at that black figure bound to
the tree-stump, "that he served a God who would come to
us from the sky, and when we asked him if he meant Tirawa,
the Old One in the Skies, he said no.  But when we asked
if this new God would come from the sunset he said it
might be, that He would come in a great blaze of glory,
with power to bend all to His will.  Is this Taivo at your
side the God of whom the first white stranger spoke?"
</p>

<p>
Tawannears turned and translated swiftly the gist of
this to me.
</p>

<p>
"Say that we come to herald the coming of that God,"
I directed him.  "Even as the white man at the stake came
to tell the Chahiksichahiks that we should come to them
from the setting sun."
</p>

<p>
The medicine-man and his fellows, even the fierce Awa,
heard this announcement with growing awe.
</p>

<p>
"For a sign," added Tawannears, "the Taivo, who permits
me to call him brother, and who is attended by the
great white warrior who has the strength of many buffalo
showed Awa, the war-chief, how he could turn aside arrows
and direct them against his enemies.  Let Awa speak for
me!"
</p>

<p>
The war-chief admitted the fact, no longer surly, but
agitated by a sense of the prestige attaching to him as
a principal participant in a miracle transcending any like
event his people had ever known.
</p>

<p>
"But what of the maiden?" he urged practically.
"Surely, Tirawa directed you to bring her here for the
sacrifice?"
</p>

<p>
"The maiden is holy," replied Tawannears.  "She has
paid the price of life here on earth.  She comes, as has
been said, from the Land of Lost Souls.  Would Tirawa
ask for the sacrifice of one who had descended from his
own lodge?"
</p>

<p>
The medicine-man interjected fierce dissent, and Awa's
arguments were stilled.
</p>

<p>
"Make them release Black Robe," I suggested as Tawannears
repeated to me what had been said.
</p>

<p>
A hush, as complete as the quietness of universal death,
had descended upon these thousands of savages, whose
glances turned from us, bound and helpless as we were,
to the equally straitened figure of the Jesuit against the
torture-stake.
</p>

<p>
"No," retorted the Seneca with a hint of humor, "but
first, brother, we must make them release us."
</p>

<p>
He fastened his eyes upon Awa.
</p>

<p>
"For many sleeps we have endured the treatment Awa's
ignorance led him to impose upon us," he declared.  "We
have been loath to slay any more of his people.  We came
hither to serve the Chahiksichahiks, to assure them of
Tirawa's favor.  But the time is arrived when we must
know if we are to receive the respect due to Tirawa's
messengers.  Shall we burst our bonds&mdash;and in doing so slay
this multitude&mdash;or will you do us honor?"
</p>

<p>
The medicine-man leaped forward, and slashed off our
bonds.  There were beads of perspiration on his brow.
Awa, magnificent savage that he was, looked away from
us, but I saw that his sinewy hands were shaking as they
clutched his horse's bridle.
</p>

<p>
"It is well," said Tawannears.  "Give my white brother,
the Messenger, the knife, and he will free the Fore-goer,
who has stood quietly at the torture-stake, holding back
the wrath of Tirawa by the pleas that came from his lips."
</p>

<p>
The medicine-man offered me the knife.
</p>

<p>
"But must a messenger of Tirawa have a knife to cut
hide thongs?" he inquired, curious as a child.
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Tawannears, "but if the power of
Tirawa is used, the power of the thunder and the lightning
which shakes the world, who shall say what harm may
come?  The Chahiksichahiks have been fools.  Let them be
satisfied with what has happened.  If they are wise they
will possess the favor of Tirawa.  If they continue to be
foolish Tirawa will wipe them out here on this spot!"
</p>

<p>
He raised his arm in a menacing gesture, and chiefs and
medicine-men cowered before him.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," pleaded the medicine-man.  "We have seen
enough.  Release the Black One with the thin face.  We
did not understand him.  He spoke to us after the manner
of the Comanche and the Dakota, telling us, as we thought,
that our gods were not, that we must worship this one he
spoke of.  We did not understand him, that waft all.  We
were ignorant, but we meant no harm."
</p>

<p>
Tawannears shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"That is to be decided," he said.  "The Taivo will
consult with Black Robe, and afterwards will speak through
me.  It is for him to decide."
</p>

<p>
I strode into the empty circle of people and walked
slowly, so as not to seem undignified, up to the stake,
stepping across the material for the fire which would now
be roasting the priest but for our unexpected arrival, and
the conjunction of circumstances it had set in train.  The
fire-makers had gone.  There was nobody inside the circle
except Black Robe and myself, and he stood yet, with his
eyes shut, a trickle of Latin pattering from his lips.
</p>

<p>
For a moment I was shocked by the traces of suffering
in that haggard face, the skin tight-drawn over the prominent
bones, the cavernous eye-holes so shadowed, the deep
lines graven in the pallid cheeks.  I seemed to see in
retrospect the labors he must have achieved in the years
since we had parted.  Who could imagine how far he had
wandered, the hardships and suffering he had borne without
the assistance of a single comforter of his own color?
And this thought enabled me to envision as never before
the ardent flame that was the driving force of his life, the
ardent devotion to a creed which ignored every other
consideration save that of the service to which he had
dedicated himself.  I warmed to him in that moment, forgetting
ancient animus, brushing aside the barrier of hostile race
and religion.
</p>

<p>
"Père Hyacinthe!" I said softly in French.
</p>

<p>
He did not open his eyes, but his lips ceased the Latin
exhortations.
</p>

<p>
"I dream!" he exclaimed to himself, in that humble
tone I had observed on a previous occasion when he forgot
himself and his stern rôle and lapsed into some gentler
habitude of the past.
</p>

<p>
"Was that Gaston's voice?  So, I remember, he crept
upon me as I read in the garden at Morbouil!  Dear olden
days!  Their memory comes so seldom.  So little time left
for the work to be done.  Ah, Jesus, the task is
heavy&mdash;heavy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He opened his eyes, peered into mine.
</p>

<p>
"You!" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, 'tis I, Father&mdash;Henry Ormerod!"
</p>

<p>
"My enemy!  France's enemy!"
</p>

<p>
"Not your enemy!  And never France's unless she
wills it.  I am come here to save you."
</p>

<p>
"How may that be?" he asked dumbly.  "Are you alone
amongst these savages?"
</p>

<p>
"Alone with my friends whom you know&mdash;and one
woman."
</p>

<p>
"Then you cannot help me," he answered decisively.
"You had best leave me, if you can.  These people are the
most independent of all the tribes.  They fear naught
save their own superstitions.  And heretic though you be,
I cannot wish you the death they plan for me."
</p>

<p>
"Yet you have not been moved by pity for me in the
same case in former years," I said curiously.
</p>

<p>
He sighed.
</p>

<p>
"The truth is hard to see.  I do not know.  I have
thought&mdash;&mdash;  But I do not know."
</p>

<p>
I cut the lashings of his arms, stooped and freed his
legs.  Not a soul spoke.  Amazement dawned in his face
that was somehow more placid than I remembered having
seen it.
</p>

<p>
"You see!" I said.  "They gave me the knife to cut you
free."
</p>

<p>
"Marvelous!" he murmured.
</p>

<p>
And he employed his first instant of freedom to reach
down stiffly with his cramped arm and lift to his lips the
crucifix which hung at his belt.
</p>

<p>
"How have you curbed them?" he asked&mdash;and he was
yet governed by that mood of gentle humility, which was
seldom of long continuance.
</p>

<p>
"I think, Father, it has been through God's mercy,"
I answered.  "But judge for yourself."
</p>

<p>
And I repeated to him, briefly, what had transpired since
Awa proudly led his warriors into the circle around the
torture-stake.  A frown clouded the Jesuit's eyes,
mouth formed a grim, hard line.
</p>

<p>
"What blasphemy is this?" he interrupted.  "Man,
would you mock the authority of heaven?  You are no more
messengers of the divine will than these savages
themselves!"
</p>

<p>
"How can you be sure!" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"How can I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused abruptly, frowning in thought.
</p>

<p>
"Is it coincidence," I continued quickly, "that when
you climbed the Mississippi bluff I would not let my
companions kill you, as they desired&mdash;and for the matter of
that, is it coincidence that once before the time of which
I speak, I saved you from them, ay, and from the wrath
of the Long House?  Is it coincidence that we were the
means of your passing the Mississippi, and that now we
and you, alike in danger of death, are saved by the
interlinking facts of our separate captivities!
</p>

<p>
"Ponder it, Père Hyacinthe!  Where does coincidence
begin and Providence end?  Are you so wise that you can
say what Heaven intends?  Can you afford to throw away
the life that has been returned to you?  Have you the
right to sacrifice four other people's lives?  How do you
know that what has happened today was not for the
purpose of giving you another opportunity to preach your
creed?"
</p>

<p>
He hesitated, head bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Go!" I said, honestly stirred.  "Say what you please!
I could stop you, but I will not take the responsibility of
interfering with another man's sense of honor.  I will
leave with you the lives of my comrades."
</p>

<p>
He looked at me, puzzled, uncertain.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know," he repeated, "It seems different.  You
are a heretic, yet&mdash;I do not know.  God's wonders
strange&mdash;I do not know&mdash;-"
</p>

<p>
"Who does?" I asked,
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I used to be sure," he said, more to himself than to
me.  "But&mdash;I do not know.  I was reconciled to death.  I
had no fear of the torment.  I hoped to move these people
at the end.  And now you say that they respect me, that
I am free, I may do as I will."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"It is too much for me to decide, Monsieur Ormerod.
Perhaps I grow weak.  Well, we shall see.  But I think it
is as you say!  I have been given a second opportunity to
woo them for Christ.  God's wonders&mdash;how strange!  How
impossible to comprehend!  And you a heretic, the
companion of a savage!  It baffles me."
</p>

<p>
He paused suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"You spoke to me first?" he questioned.  "There
was&mdash;no other?"
</p>

<p>
"None."
</p>

<p>
"Strange!" he muttered to himself again.  "Gaston&mdash;I
thought I heard&mdash;the garden at Morbouil!  Ah, Maman,
Maman!  So many, many years!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br><br>
HOMEWARD
</h3>

<p>
To my surprise, Black Robe expressed a desire to
accompany us on our continued journey East.
</p>

<p>
"I have said all that I have to say concerning what
you have told these people about me," he said simply.
"But I am sure I should lose favor in God's sight were
I to continue my mission on the strength of the heathen
superstitions you have aroused."
</p>

<p>
I pointed out to him that he would probably be exposed
to additional dangers in our company after we had crossed
the Mississippi.
</p>

<p>
"Say, instead, that you will not be exposed to so many
dangers if I am with you, Monsieur Ormerod," he
answered.  "'Tis necessary for my soul's good, as I now
realize, that I should return and seek the discipline of my
superiors.  I have wandered too long alone.  My pride hath
been unduly stirred.  In my heart I have flouted the rules
of my order.  It is best that I should go to Quebec, and
submit to the punishment my sins require."
</p>

<p>
"Sins?  What sins?" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"There are sins of the spirit as wicked as sins of the
flesh," he returned enigmatically.  "Whoso thinks himself
worthy of martyrdom therein nourishes his own pride.  But
enough hath been said on this score.  I will go with you."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" I asked.  "'Tis not your wont to profess
friendship for my people, Père Hyacinthe?"
</p>

<p>
His grim face creased in the rare smile that told of some
hidden spring of kindliness, forgotten these many years.
</p>

<p>
"You are pertinacious&mdash;like all heretics.  Go to!  Is it
forbidden that I should return good for good, as well as
for evil?"
</p>

<p>
And no more could I extract from him.  At intervals
in the months that followed he would lapse into moods of
dour fanaticism, but no matter how long they lasted the
day would come when he would smile with childlike
humility, and, silent always, contrive to invest himself with
gentle friendliness.  I do not pretend to understand the
transformation of his character; but the fact remains
that he was become a different man from the bigot who
had accused us on the Ohio.  He spoke to us only when
occasion required; Kachina he ignored completely, much
to her disgust.  But he did his full share of the work, and
his prestige sufficed to speed us on our way once the
Mississippi was behind us.
</p>

<p>
We had many weary miles to go before we reached the
Great River, however.  Awa and his medicine-man and
brother chiefs would have had us stay on in the Pawnee
villages, and opposed our departure with as much ugliness
as they dared exhibit to beings of semi-divine origin.  But
Tawannears placated them by explaining that the strong
medicine I was going to present to the tribe could only
wax to its full robust proportions after I had gone.
</p>

<p>
This medicine was prepared with many attendant
ceremonies and considerable pomp under the Seneca's
directions.  Kachina sewed a bag of deerskin, and then, in the
presence of all the Pawnee notables, I solemnly removed
from my neck the bag which Guanaea had hung there&mdash;the
arrow-slit having been repaired by Peter&mdash;and introduced
its open mouth into the throat of the bag Kachina had
made.
</p>

<p>
A suitable interval having elapsed, I removed my bag,
rehung it about my neck, fastened the neck of the new
bag and entrusted it&mdash;quite empty&mdash;to the chief medicine-man,
with strict injunctions never to open it lest the medicine
escape.  The Pawnee were satisfied.  They felt capable
of whipping any confederacy of near-by tribes, and were
convinced that they would never lack for buffalo-meat,
horses or warriors.  There was nothing they would not
do for us.  When we finally departed for the East Awa
and five hundred warriors rode with us and compelled an
Osage village to supply us with a canoe for use on the
Mississippi.
</p>

<p>
We were many days paddling below the mouth of the
Ohio, with the current against us, both on the Father of
Waters and after we had turned east into the first stream;
and Indian Summer had begun when we reached the mouth
of the Ouabache.  Here we expected to part with Black
Robe, but he surprised me again.
</p>

<p>
"You are yet many weeks' journey from your own
country, Monsieur Ormerod," he said.  "And if you continue
by water you must paddle against the current all the
way.  Why do you not strike overland direct?"
</p>

<p>
"Because your people and the tribes they control would
certainly not approve of it," I answered with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me to Vincennes," he offered.  "I will
secure you safe-conduct to Jagara."
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure&mdash;&mdash;" I began hesitantly.
</p>

<p>
"That I can do what I say!" he interrupted.  "I have
some authority in New France.  You may rest confidence
in my pledge.  I, myself, will attend you so far as Jagara.
'Tis on my way to Montreal and Quebec."
</p>

<p>
I consulted with the others, anticipating Tawannears
and Corlaer would be unwilling to trust him; but both
assented promptly.
</p>

<p>
"Black Robe is no longer a hater of those who do not
believe in his god," responded the Seneca to my query as
to his changed attitude.  "He has learned that we are
honest in what we think.  He has learned, too, that love
is the servant of truth."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>," said Peter.  "Andt he remembers der time he was
a man before he was a bpriest."
</p>

<p>
"He is a nasty old ant," declared Kachina.  "He flaps
like a raven.  <i>Ugh</i>!  I hate him!"
</p>

<p>
We paddled up the Ouabache to Vincennes, undisturbed
by the savages along the river.  The French garrison at the
trading-post eyed us with suspicion, but made no objection
to our presence.  On the trip overland to Le Detroit, the
French post on the straits betwixt the Huron Lake and
the Lake of the Eries, the priest guided us past the
scowling scrutiny of tribe after tribe, to whom Tawannears'
presence was a menacing reminder of their dreaded enemies,
the People of the Long House.  Savages, traders, habitants,
trappers, soldiers of the Lilies, all bowed and stood
aside at sight of that gaunt figure, the crippled hand
upraised in blessing.  Under the skirts of his threadbare
robe he carried us through the heart of the new empire
France was creating below the Lakes, saving us I know not
how many months of dangerous, roundabout traveling.
And from Le Detroit he escorted us to the fortress at
Jagara, which the great French soldier-statesman of the
wilderness, Joncaire, had built to form a bulwark against
the Iroquois.
</p>

<p>
'Twas here we said good-by, in the woods on the edge
of the glacis, sloping up to the stone walls of the fort.
In the distance we heard the subdued roar of the mighty
falls.  On the walls of the fort stood the white-coated
sentinels of France.  At our feet commenced a tenuous trail,
the Northern approach to the Western Door of the Long
House.
</p>

<p>
Black Robe gave Tawannears the Iroquois salute of
parting.  He pressed Peter's hand.  On Kachina he
bestowed his blessing.
</p>

<p>
"There is a place on Christ's bosom for you, my daughter,"
he said in the Seneca dialect, which she had mastered.
</p>

<p>
She scowled back at him in a way that must have
compelled a man with a sense of humor to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"We are not Christians," Tawannears stated proudly.
"The gods of our people are good enough for us.  Have
they not reunited us in the face of death&mdash;and beyond!"
</p>

<p>
The priest sighed and drew me to one side.
</p>

<p>
"Do you ever pray, Monsieur Ormerod?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I have done so."
</p>

<p>
"Forget not one Louis Joseph Marie de Kerguezac.  He
is dead, Monsieur, although he lives.  I pray you, forget
him not.  He needs your prayers, ay, heretic or not, he
needs them!  So, too, I fear doth one Hyacinthe, of the
Order of Jesus, a hard man, who hath wreaked harm
under cover of saintliness.  Ah, God, how little do we
know what we do!"
</p>

<p>
"Hard you have been in times past, Father," I replied,
"but I bear testimony you have redeemed yourself in my
eyes&mdash;albeit I hold I, nor any other man, may judge you
after what you have suffered for your faith."
</p>

<p>
He considered this, crucifix in hand.
</p>

<p>
"Who can say!" he said at length.  "I have lived
over-much self-centered.  Never trust yourself too far,
Monsieur Ormerod.  Man is&mdash;man!  You, too, have suffered.
Therefore you will know that suffering is worth while&mdash;so
long as you do not seek satisfaction in it.  You, Monsieur,
went forth to forget a woman&mdash;near four years ago, was
it not?  Have you&mdash;forgotten?"
</p>

<p>
'Twas my turn to think.
</p>

<p>
"Not forgotten," I decided, stirred, but not resentful.
"Yet the pain is dead.  Say, rather, reconciled to loss."
</p>

<p>
His face was contorted with agony.
</p>

<p>
"Four years, and reconciled!  Monsieur Ormerod, I
have striven to forget for twenty years, and the pain still
burns my soul!  I chose the wrong way, the wrong way!"
</p>

<p>
He turned and stumbled from the forest, hands outthrust
before him, as he walked blindly toward the fort.
</p>

<p>
"The wrong way!  The wrong way!"
</p>

<p>
They were the last words I heard him speak.  Months
later, in New York, the news came from Quebec that the
famous Père Hyacinthe, called far and wide the Apostle to
the Savages, was serving a disciplinary sentence as
scullery servant in the headquarters of the Order of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
On the afternoon of the second day after leaving Jagara
we were challenged by an out-flung party of Seneca Wolves,
Watchers of the Door, who made the forest aisles ring with
their whoops of joy when they recognized Tawannears,
clamoring for the story of our wanderings.  But at his
first question joy was turned to sadness, for they gave
us the sorry tidings that Donehogaweh, the Guardian
of the Door, lay at the point of death from a gangrened
wound that had festered about the barbed head of a Miami
arrow, shot into his shoulder during his last punitive raid.
</p>

<p>
We forgot all else in our haste to reach Deonundagaa
in time to see the Royaneh before his end; and there
remained a lingering splash of color in the Western sky as
we trotted out of the forest, crossed the gardens and
entered the village streets lined by the long ganasotes and
thronged with mourning people.  They exclaimed with
amazement at sight of Corlaer's vast bulk and Tawannears'
familiar figure.  An irregular column formed at our
heels, warriors who strove for a word with members of
our escort, gossiping women and children who babbled and
shrieked amongst themselves.
</p>

<p>
So we came to the open space by the council lodge.  Beside
its entrance Donehogaweh lay on a pallet of skins, in
compliance with his request to pass in the outer air.  A
group of Royanehs and chiefs sat about him, sternly
watching, their sympathy unspoken, their faces emotionless.
Guanaea hovered over him, equally silent, but unable to
restrain the sorrow that was revealed in her eyes and trembling
lips.  'Twas her cry of astonishment gave him the first
intimation of our coming.  He turned his great head,
with its gray-streaked scalp-lock, and his fever-bright eyes
dwelt upon us almost unbelievingly.
</p>

<p>
"Is it indeed you, oh, my sister's son?" he asked weakly.
"Do I see with you Otetiani, the white son of my old age,
and Corlaer of the fat belly?  Or do evil dreams taunt
me again?"
</p>

<p>
"We are here, oh, my uncle," answered Tawannears
kneeling by the pallet and drawing Kachina down beside
him.
</p>

<p>
"And who is the maiden with you?"
</p>

<p>
"She is your daughter."
</p>

<p>
"My daughter?  Not&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Guanaea emitted a little shriek and ran closer.
</p>

<p>
"Gahano?" questioned the dying Royaneh.
</p>

<p>
The group of chiefs bent forward, startled out of their
stoical self-control.  Guanaea knelt beside Tawannears and
Kachina, her eyes boring into the girl's face.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she is Gahano," said Tawannears.  "Tawannears
and his white brothers have been to the Land of Lost
Souls, which is beyond the sunset.  They have passed the
barriers of Haniskaonogeh.  They have ventured upon the
altar of Hawenneyu.  They have crossed the mountains at
the end of the world, where all is ice and snow.  They
have traversed Dayedadogowar, the Great Home of the
Winds.  And in the Land of Lost Souls they had speech
with Ataentsic and Jouskeha, as is told in the traditions of
our people, and the Lost Soul of Gahano came from a
pumpkin shell and danced, and we took her and fled to our
own country."
</p>

<p>
"She is different from the Gahano I bore," protested
Guanaea, breaking the dead silence that ensued, whilst the
blazing eyes of the old Royaneh probed the faces of the
pair beside him.
</p>

<p>
Kachina peered sideways at her a thought mutinously,
but held her peace, failing any sign from Tawannears.
</p>

<p>
Donehogaweh feebly nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"She would look different," he announced.  "Who would
not look different after death?  Shall I look the same an
hour hence?  Yes, she is different&mdash;and yet like the Gahano
who was.  And in truth did you find the Land of Lost Souls,
Tawannears?"
</p>

<p>
'Twas Corlaer who answered, speaking with a resonant
ease that so oddly became him when using an Indian
dialect instead of English.
</p>

<p>
"It was all exactly as foretold in the legends," he said.
"This maiden had come there direct from the custody of
the Great Spirit.  She was delivered in charge of him who
was Jouskeha.  Ataentsic was not willing to give her
up, but Jouskeha aided us and we took her by force, the
Great Spirit aiding us."
</p>

<p>
That was a long speech for the Dutchman.  I felt
myself called upon to support him.
</p>

<p>
"If that was not the Land of Lost Souls," I declared,
"then the legends of the Hodenosaunee are a mockery."
</p>

<p>
"Yo-hay!" cried Donehogaweh, and he heaved himself
to his haunches.  "Welcome back to my lodge, Gahano,
although you go from it to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He choked and fell dead.
</p>

<p>
"Woe!  Woe!" wept Guanaea.  "The pine-tree is fallen!
The light is clouded.  In my lodge now all is darkness and
despair!"
</p>

<p>
Tawannears caught her hand.
</p>

<p>
"But see, you who are almost my mother," he said.  "I
have brought back to you the daughter who was lost to you.
We will be son and daughter to you in your loneliness."
</p>

<p>
Guanaea would not be comforted.
</p>

<p>
"Who am I to scorn the generosity of Hawenneyu?"
she cried.  "Who am I to doubt the deeds of great
warriors?  I am only a woman, only a mother whose offspring
left her, only a widow whose man went ahead of her into
the land of shadows.  Yet I cannot take this new Gahano
to my breast.  She is not to me as the child I suckled or
the maiden whose waywardness I curbed.  Nay, I can only
mourn.  I am an old woman.  I have outlived my time!
I will cover my face and sit by the ashes of the fire and
weep!"
</p>

<p>
She threw her robe around her head and tottered away
to the lodge she had shared with Donehogaweh, attended by
the old women of her clan.
</p>

<p>
Ganeodiyo, senior Royaneh of the Senecas, stooped over
and closed the eyes of his dead colleague, then rose.
</p>

<p>
"Tawannears has spent many moons upon a twisting
trail," he said.  "He and his white brothers have made
us proud of them.  They have done what no other
warriors have done.  There was a stain upon the women of
their tribe, but they have wiped it off.  It is well!  Our
eyes are dazzled by the splendor of their achievement.  Our
ears do not hear distinctly, for the cries of the enemies
they vanquished.  The face of the maiden they have recovered
seems strange to us, but we shall grow accustomed to
her again.  Her feet will seek out the ways she knew of old.
All will be as it was before.  She will seem as though she
had never departed.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Na-ho!</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Peter," I said, when we were alone together in the
guest-chamber of the ganasote of the bachelors of the Wolf
Clan, "have we done well to lie?"
</p>

<p>
He regarded me with twinkling eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Lie?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, lie," I insisted.  "Have we not lent our
countenance to an essential falsehood?"
</p>

<p>
He meditated.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>, we liedt&mdash;maype," he admitted finally.  "Dot is,
we saidt dot what Tawannears saidt was so&mdash;andt dot's
no lie."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"You pelief dot Tawannears peliefs what he says?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"He wouldt die if he fought idt was not true."  Corlaer
spoke with extraordinary vehemence for him.  "You
nefer knew a man who worshiped der trut' more than
Tawannears.  What he says he saw andt didt is true&mdash;isn't
it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Andt what you don't pelief is true is dot 'Lost Souls'
pusiness, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"But Tawannears peliefs idt is true&mdash;don't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, Peter.  I've already said so."
</p>

<p>
"What is a lie, then, eh?  You t'ink der Lost Souls
is&mdash;funny-pusiness.  Tawannears t'inks idt is gospel.  Now,
who is lying&mdash;you or Tawannears?"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nein, nein!  Not so quick.  Tawannears knew what
he was looking for, eh?  Andt you didt not.  Why shouldt
you say dot Tawannears is lying any more than you?  You
saw what Tawannears saidt dot you wouldt see.  He was
right in dot, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"So idt is," continued Peter inexorably.  "Tawannears
peliefs what he saidt.  You do not.  If anybody lies, you
lie.  Idt is your lie, not Tawannears'.  But how can you
be sure Tawannears is wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"The girl Kachina&mdash;Guanaea&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Kachina looks like Gahano.  Andt it is like Donehogaweh
saidt&mdash;if she has peen deadt, how can she look der
same?  Nein!"
</p>

<p>
"But Guanaea!" I insisted.
</p>

<p>
"She is a woman, andt women are funny beoble.  She
nefer liked Gahano pefore."
</p>

<p>
"And what do you think, yourself, Peter?"
</p>

<p>
"I pelief what Tawannears says.  Idt is goodt for him to
pelief idt.  Idt hurts nopody, eh?  So I pelief.  <i>Ja</i>, dot's
goodt!"

CHAPTER XXVI
<br><br>
THE END OF THE TRAIL
</h3>

<p>
The forest trees and the brown grass stubble of the
meadow beneath their skeleton boughs were powdered
lightly with snow, except where a tiny fire
burned, its smoke floating upward into the overhanging
tree-tops.  On the far side of the field, backed by the roofs
of the village, was massed the population of Deonundagaa,
men, women and children.  Besides the fire the robes of the
seven surviving Royanehs of the Senecas, headed by
Ganeodiyo, each with his assistant behind him, made a
splash of vivid color.
</p>

<p>
Dimly through the bare foliage I glimpsed the long
file of the Royanehs of the other four nations&mdash;the
Mohawks, Dagoeoga, the Shield People; the Onondagas,
Hodesannogeta, the Name-Bearers; the Oneidas, Neardeondargowar,
Great Tree People; the Cayugas, Sonushogwatowar,
Great Pipe People.  The Tuscaroras, sixth nation in the
great league, had no representation in the Hoyarnagowar,
because the founders had created only so many names, or
seats, and no Iroquois would have thought of altering the
framework they built; but a group of Tuscarora chieftains
followed in the train of the Royanehs, mute witnesses by
right to what should transpire.
</p>

<p>
I have seen many ceremonies in my day.  I have watched
the Pope celebrate mass in St. Peter's.  I have attended at
the mummery of the French Court, with the splendor of
Versailles and the Louvre for background.  But I have
never seen aught more imposing than the rites of the
condoling council of the Iroquois, the ceremonies by which at
one and the same time they express their appreciation of
a great man who has died and install his successor, beginning
with the ceremony Deyughnyonkwarakta, "At the
Wood's Edge."
</p>

<p>
Slowly, at a sign from Hoyowenato, the Keeper of the
Wampum, the long file of the Royanehs paced out from the
forest and formed in a half-circle opposite the little group
of Seneca Royanehs, with the fire betwixt them.  Then
Ganeodiyo, spokesman for the Senecas, stepped forward
with arms outflung in welcome to the visitors.  His trained
orator's voice rolled in the measured cadences of the stately
ritual, opening with the sentence&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Onenh weghniserade wakatyerenkowa desawennawenrate
ne kenteyurhoton!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Now, today, I have been greatly startled by your voices
coming through the forest to this opening."
</p>

<p>
And proceeding in the set phrases of the greeting:
</p>

<p>
"You have come with troubled minds through all
obstacles.  You kept seeing the places where they met on
whom we depended, my offspring.  How then can your
mind be at ease?  You kept seeing the footmarks of our
forefathers; and all but perceptible is the smoke where
they used to smoke the pipe together.  Can, then, your
mind be at ease when you are weeping on your way?
</p>

<p>
"Great thanks, therefore, that you have safely arrived.
Now let us smoke the pipe together.  Because all around
are hostile agencies, which are each thinking&mdash;'I will
frustrate their purpose.'  Here thorny ways, and here falling
trees, and here wild beasts lying in ambush.  Either by
these you might have perished, my offspring, or here by
floods you might have been destroyed, my offspring, or by
the uplifted hatchet in the dark outside the house.  Every
day these are wasting us; or deadly invisible disease might
have destroyed you, my offspring."
</p>

<p>
The echoing voice went on, flexing the emotions of the
words like a great organ.  The orator recited the rules the
forefathers had laid down.  He repeated the traditional
list of the villages of the three original clans, the Wolf,
the Tortoise and the Bear.  Then the fire was put out, and
one by one the Royanehs marched from the meadow to
the council house of the village, where a new fire was
kindled by Ganeodiyo, and they sat in a wide circle on
robes placed for them by their assistants.
</p>

<p>
Hoyowennato produced the pipe of ceremony from its
case; the mystically-carven soapstone bowl was filled with
tobacco and he handed it to Ganeodiyo, who lighted it
with a coal from the council fire, blew the required puffs
to the four quarters and to the earth and the sky and
passed it on to Tododaho, senior of all the Royanehs, he
who sits beside the ancient undying council fire of the
League, which has burned for ages of ages at Onondaga.
The pipe went the rounds of the circle and was returned to
Hoyowennato, who replaced it in its case.
</p>

<p>
Tododaho rose.
</p>

<p>
"My offspring, now this day we are met together," he
intoned.  "The Great Spirit has appointed this day.  We
are met together on account of the solemn event which
has befallen you.  Now into the earth he has been
conveyed to whom we have been wont to look.  Therefore in
tears we have smoked together.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then, we say, we wipe away the tears, so that
in peace you may look about you.
</p>

<p>
"And further, we suppose there is an obstruction in
your ears.  Now, then, we remove the obstruction carefully
from your hearing, so that we trust you will easily hear
the words spoken.
</p>

<p>
"And also we imagine there is an obstruction in your
throat.  Now, therefore, we say, we remove the obstruction,
so that you may speak freely in our mutual greetings.
</p>

<p>
"Now again another thing, my offspring.  I have spoken
of the solemn event which has befallen you.  Every day you
are losing your great men.  They are being borne into the
earth; so that in the midst of blood you are sitting.
</p>

<p>
"Now, therefore, we say, we wash off the blood-marks
from your seat, so that it may be for a time that happily
the place will be clean where you are seated.
</p>

<p>
"And now, that our hearts may be prepared for the
instructions of our forefathers and the memory of their
greatness, we sing the hymn 'Yondonghs Aihaigh.'"
</p>

<p>
Almost a hundred voices boomed out the rhythmic lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I come again to greet and thank the League;<br>
  I come again to greet and thank the kindred;<br>
  I come again to greet and thank the warriors;<br>
  I come again to greet and thank the women.<br>
  My forefathers&mdash;what they established&mdash;<br>
  My forefathers&mdash;hearken to them!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And after the song was ended, Tododaho walked up and
down the council house, crying out:
</p>

<p>
"Hail, my grandsires!  Now hearken while your grandchildren
cry mournfully to you&mdash;because the Great League
which you established has grown old.
</p>

<p>
"Even now, oh, my grandsires, that has become old
which you established&mdash;the Great League!  You have it
as a pillow under your heads in the ground where you
are lying&mdash;this Great League which you established;
although you said that far away in the future the Great
League would endure."
</p>

<p>
A second time they sang the hymn, and then Tododaho
called the roll of the founders, commencing with Tehkarihhoken
and ending with Tyuhninhohkawenh, and after each
name the Royanehs thundered the responses:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "This was the roll of you,<br>
  You who were joined in the work,<br>
  You who completed the work,<br>
  The Great League!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Tododaho reseated himself, and a Royaneh of the Cayugas
rose to speak for the so-called Younger Nations&mdash;the
Cayugas, Oneidas and Tuscaroras.
</p>

<p>
"Now our uncle has passed away," he recited, "he who
used to work for all, that they might see the brighter days
to come&mdash;for the whole body of warriors and also for the
whole body of women, and also for the children that were
running around, and also for the little ones creeping on
the ground, and also for those that are tied to the
cradle-boards; for all these he used to work that they might see
the bright days to come.  This we say, we Three Brothers.
</p>

<p>
"Now another thing we will say, we Younger Brothers.
You are mourning in the deep darkness.  I will make the
sky clear for you, so that you will not see a cloud.  And
also I will give the sun to shine upon you, so that you can
look upon it peacefully when it goes down.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then, another thing we say, we three Younger
Brothers.  If any one should fall&mdash;it may be a principal
chief will fall, a Royaneh, and descend into the grave&mdash;as
soon as possible another shall be put in his place.  This we
say, we three Younger Brothers.
</p>

<p>
"Now I have finished.  Now show me the man!"
</p>

<p>
A hush mantled the council house.  All eyes turned
toward the door where Tawannears stood with Peter and
me.  Ganeodiyo and another Seneca Royaneh rose from
their places and crossed the room to us.  At a sign
Tawannears went to meet them.  They took position, one on each
side, with their hands under his elbows, and so guided him
into the center of the circle around the council fire.  Three
times they walked him around the circuit of Royanehs.
Then Ganeodiyo spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Denehogaweh is dead, oh, Royanehs!  Our eyes have
been blinded with tears.  Our hearts have been heavy.
Loudly we have cried our grief.  But the forefathers laid
down rules for us to follow and we have followed them.
A vacant place must be filled.  Work laid aside must be
completed.  The places left by the founders must be carried
on that our children may continue to have peace.
</p>

<p>
"Behold, oh, Royanehs, after the tradition of our people,
as required by the founders, the wise women of the Wolf
Clan gathered in Council.  They considered deeply.
Donehogaweh was dead.  Another of his line must succeed him.
Donehogaweh was the Guardian of the Western Door.  No
foes entered the Long House after he kept watch.  Who
should endeavor to take his place?
</p>

<p>
"The wise women pondered, oh, Royanehs.  They
continued to ponder.  They remembered that Donehogaweh
had a nephew, Tawannears, Warden of the Door.  He was
his uncle's prop, his right hand, a tried warrior, feared by
the enemies of the Great League, respected by the subject
nations, the friend of our friends.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Royanehs, we present him to you!  He is no longer
Tawannears.  He is Donehogaweh!  He is the Guardian
of the Western Door.  Give him your favor!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Aigh!  Aighhaigh!  Kwa, Kwa!</i>" applauded the Royanehs.
</p>

<p>
Peter and I slipped out of the door as they formed in
procession and took our station with Kachina&mdash;for I
cannot bring myself to give her the name Gahano by which
Tawannears always addressed her&mdash;to watch the formal
presentation to the assemblage of Senecas gathered in the
open around the gaondote, or war-post.  A shout of
approval came from the people when Tawannears, now
Donehogaweh, was led forth by Tododaho and Ganeodiyo.
</p>

<p>
"The Guardian of the Door!" they cried.  "He is
favored by Hawenneyu!  <i>Kwa!  Kwa!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Kachina clapped her hands with glee&mdash;one of many
tricks that proved to me her Caucasian origin.
</p>

<p>
"He has his uncle's place!" she exclaimed.  "I was
afraid that fat old she-ant, Guanaea, would make trouble
for him.  I will put a snake in her bed some night."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" I rebuked her.  "She is your mother.  Her
eyes are clouded by grief.  Be kind, and she will learn
to love you."
</p>

<p>
"Love me!  <i>Hai</i>, I care not whether she loves me.  I
have Tawannears' love, and that is enough."
</p>

<p>
Peter plucked me by the sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"Come!" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
I followed him behind the nearest ganasote, and he
pointed to a narrow opening in the wall of the forest
opposite, the throat of the great trail of the Long House.
</p>

<p>
"Here is no blace for us," he said.  "We hafe saidt
goodt-by to Tawannears&mdash;who is no longer Tawannears.
He has a new life to lif.  He must be an Indian of Indians.
He has a wife andt a mother-in-law&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who is not his mother-in-law," I gibed.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>, berhaps.  But dot doesn't matter now.  We are
white men.  He is an Indian.  We don't do him no goodt
for a time.  We petter go, andt leafe him to himself."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I agreed slowly.  "You are right, Peter.  'Tis
strange how tactful you can be&mdash;and how talkative.  But
where shall we go?"
</p>

<p>
He gave me a curious look.
</p>

<p>
"It's petter you go home, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Home?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja</i>!  New York&mdash;der gofernor&mdash;andt&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He left the sentence unfinished, for which I was duly
grateful.  I was conscious of no impelling urge to return
to civilization.  The zest which had attended our
homeward journey was gone from me.  But I could not argue
against Peter's suggestion.  The governor expected a
report from me.  For the rest, I shrugged my shoulders.  But
I did not hunger for the house in Pearl Street.  I did not
even attempt to picture what awaited me there.
</p>

<p>
A snowstorm overtook us near the headwaters of the
Mohawk, and after securing snowshoes from an Oneida
village we decided we might as well save time by pushing
straight southeast through the forest country on the west
bank of Hudson's River, avoiding Fort Orange* and the
contiguous settlement, and crossing the river at the first
point we came to where the ice would hold.  Corlaer knew
every inch of this wild land, and was never at a loss to steer
a bee-line in any direction he fancied.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* Albany.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But as a result of this we saw no other white men until
we reached the outlying villages above New York, and
their residents could give us no tidings of the town's
affairs, for they had been cut off by the great drifts since
Christmas&mdash;a feast to which we had given no thought.
We had completely lost track of days and were not even
sure of the month.  For years we had regulated ourselves
by the seasons.  It was hot or cold, Winter or Summer,
with us.  We let it go at that.
</p>

<p>
The burghers of the Out-ward eyed us askance for the
wastrels we seemed in our deerskin shirts and leggings,
bearskin robes belted about us, hair and beard sweeping
our shoulders.  And as it chanced, we saw none we knew
until we reached the Broadway just above the Green Lane,
when honest John Allen, my clerk, turned the corner in
face of us and would have passed on, with an uneasy
glance for our ruffian pair.
</p>

<p>
"How, now!" I cried.  "Is it so you greet your master,
John?"
</p>

<p>
He dropped his bundle of papers in the snow and his
chin sagged to his chest.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis never you, Master Ormerod!  Why, we had given
you up two years gone&mdash;all, that is, save Master Burnet.
But for him the magistrates would have settled your
estate."
</p>

<p>
Now, why it was I know not, but at this I was smitten
with an insane desire to laugh, and I rocked my sides so
that people across the way deemed me witless and hastened
by us.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad there is one man of intelligence left," I
said when I had found my breath again.  "But I never
doubted the governor, John."
</p>

<p>
"He is governor no longer, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
Even Peter fetched out a shrill Dutch curse.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sir.  But last month the Lords of Trade gave him
notice transferring him to Massachusetts.  He sailed ten
days since."
</p>

<p>
"He is gone hence?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis so, sir."
</p>

<p>
"But who has his place!"
</p>

<p>
"Master Montgomery, sir.  And oh, Master Ormerod,
things are very different from what they were.  The
malcontents in the town have the new governor's ear.  There
is much ado about municipal reforms, and small thought
to the fur-trade and the alliances with the savages that
Master Burnet gave thought to."
</p>

<p>
I clapped an arm on Peter's fat shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Then here are two shall give Master Montgomery somewhat
to think on," I proclaimed.  "We'll tell him of the
Wilderness Country, eh, Peter?  We'll acquaint him with
the doings of the French!  We'll make plain to him the
empires and kingdoms that lie waiting the Englishman, if
he have but the courage of his ancestors!"
</p>

<p>
"Nein," said Peter.  "You go."
</p>

<p>
"But you?"
</p>

<p>
"I go wit' John here."
</p>

<p>
"Have it your own way," I returned cavalierly.  "Shall
I find the governor in the fort, John?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sir."  He hesitated.  "But sure, Master Ormerod,
you'll stop in Pearl Street.  Elspeth and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Anon, anon," I said airily.  "I am not much of a
home-body, John."
</p>

<p>
And I swaggered on my way, poor fool, secretly fearful
of the memories that Pearl Street might evoke.
</p>

<p>
At the fort I was recognized by an officer, and he passed
me into the governor's house with a celerity that made me
fume all the more during the hour I must cool my heels
in his anteroom.  But all things end in time, even the
whims of jacks-in-office.  A liveried servant opened the
inner door, and I was ushered in my motley forest-garb
into a room which expressed in every detail the finicking
niceties of its occupant.
</p>

<p>
A small man, with a pompous carriage, insignificant
features expressing vanity and pride, Master Montgomery
made no effort to disguise his displeasure that a citizen
should have ventured to appear before him so roughly
dressed.
</p>

<p>
"Master Ormerod?" he said.  "Ah, yes, I am aware
who you are, sir.  The late&mdash;ah&mdash;governor was pleased to
give me some account of you, and of the&mdash;ah&mdash;ridiculous
mission upon which he was pleased to dispatch you.  Close
to four years gone, was it not?  You have been overlong,
sir.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"One moment," I interrupted.  "You call my mission
ridiculous.  Are you aware, sir, that I have traveled where
no Englishman has been before?  Do you understand the
value of the information I bring?  Does it mean nothing
that I have news of the French dispositions in the
Wilderness Country?"
</p>

<p>
He waved me to silence.
</p>

<p>
"You attach unnecessary importance to your wanderings,
Master Ormerod," he reproved me.  "Here, sir, we
have work sufficient to occupy us for many generations.
The&mdash;ah&mdash;failures of my predecessor, I venture to assert,
may be ascribed to his unfortunate predilection to
extravagant views and policies.  The day for such delusions, I
assure you, is past.  Here in New York we are now occupied
with the important task of improving the lot of our loyal,
law-abiding citizens, and the abatement of hindrances to
trade and commerce."
</p>

<p>
He selected a paper from several on the table before him.
</p>

<p>
"I have here a draft of a new charter I am issuing to
the citizens!  Too little attention has been paid to such
matters, and it shall be my care to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do I understand you have no ear for my report, your
Excellency?" I broke in.
</p>

<p>
"Some other time, Master Ormerod.  At the present, I
am occupied with affairs of serious moment."
</p>

<p>
"But the French&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Tut, tut, sir," he remonstrated severely.  "Here is
overmuch stress upon the French.  Another fault of
my&mdash;ah&mdash;distinguished predecessor was to exaggerate the animosity
of the French.  Treat the French fairly, live and let live,
so you may construe my policy.  I have no fault to find
with French expansion.  There is land enough for all on
this continent.  As for the near-by savages, we have
humored them more than is good for them.  In future&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
How I got from that room I do not remember, but in
some way I dammed the flow of pompous rhetoric and futile
reasoning, brushed by all who would have questioned me
in the fort, and found my way by oft-trodden paths into
Pearl Street.  I was still seething with indignation as the
red-brick house came in view.  When I tapped at the
door none answered me, so I pushed it open and entered
the wide hallway.  I called, but no answer was returned.
And then I heard a bubbling chuckle of mirth in the rear
garden, capped by Corlaer's squeaking laughter.
</p>

<p>
It was as if a secret hammer tapped at my heart.  I
caught my breath, and stepped softly through the corridor
to the door which gave on the garden.  On the steps
below me sat stout Scots Elspeth, heedless of the snow, and
John Allen, both of them helpless with laughter; and in the
garden's center a small, lusty urchin in breeches, a wooden
scalping knife clutched in one mitten-covered fist, circled
cautiously the ponderous figure of Corlaer, who
contrived a most realistic mimicry of panic-fear.
</p>

<p>
"And now I shall scalp you!" the urchin shrieked
gleefully.
</p>

<p>
But Peter gestured him towards me, and the boy turned
with a glad cry.  The knife dropped from his hand.  There
was a scurry of feet, and two arms were stretched up to
me, two brown eyes&mdash;eyes that it seemed I had looked into
so many times before&mdash;shone into mine.
</p>

<p>
"You have come back!" shouted the treble voice.
"John said you would!  And so did Master Burnet!  Do
you always wear a beard!  Will you buy me clothes like
those you and Peter wear?  Will you teach me to cast the
tomahawk and shoot with the bow and arrow?  Will you
take me to live with the Indians?  Did you kill very many
this time?  What did you find beyond the sunset?"
</p>

<p>
I swept him in my arms, gray eyes beaming steadily
through the mist that veiled my sight.
</p>

<p>
"I found contentment&mdash;and love," I said.
</p>

<p>
Elspeth burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hecht</i>, but them's the bonny worrds," she blubbered.
"The master's hame and richt in his mind again!"

My son's bubbling laughter stirred me afresh, and I
peered over his shoulder to perceive Corlaer waltzing like
a clumsy bear, with John Allen's sedate person clasped
against his enormous belly.  And I sat down beside the boy
and laughed, too, laughed as I had laughed in bygone years,
with the joyous vigor of a happy heart.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
